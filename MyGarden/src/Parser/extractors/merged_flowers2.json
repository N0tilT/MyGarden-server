He appears before any other cereals - see him You can, as soon as the snow came down. A similar culture is found in almost any country in the world. Previously, the rebel was used as fodder grass, now it became a full -fledged lawn culture. Lugovoi’s rebellion is great for decorating lawns according to “external data”, in addition, it excellently tolerates many plant diseases. It will be early to ripen this culture, and therefore at the very beginning of the season it will please the owners of the sites. You can walk on a rebel relatively calmly - He is almost not subject to trampling.\n\nThe following characteristics are also said in favor of such plants:\n\n\n\tsmall requirements for the composition of the Earth (no more than for ordinary garden crops);\n\texcellent survival in frost and drainage;\n\tthe possibility of growing in one place up to 40 years;\n\teffective regeneration for any deformation;\n\tthe formation of a homogeneous carpet;\n\tThe simplicity of everyday care.

In the Efron's Encyclopedic Dictionary of 1890, the plant is described under the name Agatat, and in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia of 1950 - Alligator Pear. In modern Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, the name of Palta (Palto) and Aguacate, in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic-Aguacatero is widespread. The American Perseus is an evergreen tall tree (up to 13-16, and sometimes up to 20 m). Some representatives of the Perseus family are shrubs, but avocado is a tree With a well -expressed straight or curved trunk. Most often, the trunk is straight, but branched. Although on industrial plantations, the barrel may not be too noticeable: many trees are grown by vaccination and pruned.\n\nCrohn is spreading, bell -shaped or spherical. The branches are low, quickly begin to branch, the crown is often width more than in height. The bark on young branches is bright, yellow-green, then it becomes cooler in color-to beige-gray-green Colors. In adult trees, the bark is rough, even, sometimes with longitudinal grooves. The roots of the tree are shallow.\n\nThe leaves are leathery, elliptical, bright and light green, large, up to 35 cm long, with clearly noticeable veins. In width, the leaf plate reaches 5-12 cm, and a bluish tint has a bluish on the bottom. The upper surface of the sheet has a weak shine and barely noticeable pubescence, but the delicate fluff is well noticeable on the bottom. The tip of the sheet is pointed, the veins are good Viewed. The edges are whole, smooth, sometimes with light waves. Flows 2-5 cm long.\n\nThe flowers are small, 5-6 mm, nondescript, greenish-white, appear in the sinuses of leaves. Gathered in inflorescences-metels, bisexual. The flower tube is very short, the corolla is 6 oblong leaves up to 5 mm in size, 3 of them are slightly shorter than others. Each flower has 9 fertile stamens laid in three circles. In the fruits of Persei American, a pleasant nut and grass taste. Sometimes coniferous notes are felt. Ripe fruits have a delicate, creamy and oily consistency, oilyness is well felt in the tongue. A little unripe fruits are hard, the taste is uncertain or soap.\n\nAlthough avocado fruits are removed from trees in maturity, they reach the desired state only 1-2 weeks after removal. Cleaning to the maturity period is undesirable, such fruits will not be able to ripen. In industrial conditions, cleaning time is carefully spelled out, the pulp should be more than 23%. At a temperature of +3-5 ° C, such fruits They retain freshness for 2 months, after the sale they ripen in a few days.\n\nAvocado fruit independently falling from the tree is not found on sale. It will contain many oils, but it is almost impossible to store, transport and sell it. A completely ripened and ready -made fruit is stored for no more than 5 days even in the refrigerator. Half of the species of Persei live in East and Southeast Asia, part in South and North America, in tropical zones. The American Perseus originally grew in Central America, a more accurate habitat - Mesoamerica. These are the alpine areas of the Central Mexico, Guatemala and Salvador. Today, the plant is cultivated in all corners of the planet with a suitable climate: in Africa, in Israel, in the USA (Florida), in the Caribbean basin. Eight natural species of Persei American are described, of which three are especially widely common.\n\n\n\tPersea America Var. Drymifolia is from the highlands of the Center and East of Mexico. Find out if it is Vyidov tree, you can, having lost the leaves. Persea America Var. Drymifolia exudes a noticeable aroma of liquor or anise. Leaves are used as a spice, sold fresh and dried. A variety is called Mexican avocados. The optimum temperature for growing avocados is +16-29 ° C, the place is recommended sunny, only a very light partial shade is permissible. In open ground, the tree lives up to 50 years. In the middle lane of Persei is grown as a indoor and greenhouse plant. Can withstand A short -term decrease in temperature to -2 ° C, but in any case, wintering should be warm. Life life in closed ground is 20 years. Avocado is a mild plant for tropical conditions, it is hardy, it grows rapidly, it needs only a sunny place and a sufficient amount of moisture.\n\nThe basis for growing should be light, perfectly drained, quite acidic, with pH in 5.1-7.5 units. A loose nutritious loam is best suited, covered with a layer of light mulch. Perseus does not like heavy soils and stagnation of moisture. Water it often. Immediately after landing - 2 times a week, then we need moderate watering, 1 time per week, as the soil dries. In the rooms, the crown is sprayed 2 times a month. They are fertilized infrequently: 1 time in spring and 1 time in summer a weak solution of the mineral complex for indoor plants.\n\nFrequent pruning will be required, especially in the rooms, since the tree can grow up to 15 m in height. Foliage can suffer from aphids. Black soot plaque is washed off with warm soapy water. With wrong Watering is the risk of root rot or detachment of the bark. The American Persia is growing rapidly, tolerates a haircut well, but does not have outstanding decorative qualities. In cold countries, avocados are grown as an indoor tubular tree with a mandatory regular haircut. Disadvantages: too large leaves, rapid growth, you need a large pot, at home the fruits are almost impossible to get.\n\nMost often, avocados are grown from a bone as fun or entertainment for children, Because the process comes out visual, and bones from ripe fruits lightly sprout. In warm countries, in California and Florida in the United States, avocados are occasionally planted as an accent tree in the yard. In Central America and Mexico, the fruits of avocado were an important product of daily food before the arrival of the Spaniards. Avocado fruits contain a high percentage (up to 26%) of vegetable oils, fatty acids, vitamins, proteins and minerals. Avocado oil is used in dietary nutrition, cosmetology, folk Medicine. It has antioxidant properties and is part of some drugs for osteoarthritis, expectorants.\n\nAvocado is used in salads, first and second dishes, in side dishes, for the preparation of guacamol, sushi, as an addition to sandwiches, hot dogs. In South America, avocados are included in local dishes, among them Sankocho soup, Achiako soup, stuffed avocado, Venezuelan guaskachi, Caus Limena, Guacamole salad. In Argentina, a sweet cream made of pulp avocado, lime or Orange, sugar and cream. In Colombia - a cocktail of avocado pulp, milk and sugar. The national dish of Colombia, the Bandeh Payce, among other components necessarily contains avocados. In 2021, Canadian scientists in avocado discovered a unique substance - Avocatin V. This is a fat molecule that can stop the growth of cancer cells, it can be used to treat acute myeloid leukemia. The molecule does not contain any other products.\n\n10 years ago, the avocado was not part of The number of the most popular fruits. But due to the fashion for healthy nutrition, its popularity was experienced by a sharp take -off. From 2010 to 2018, its production volumes in the world have increased by 2.2 times. It is likely that the fruits of Persei of the American in the coming years will be able to become as familiar as apples or bananas.|||Austrocédrus Cypress Austredrus Austredrus Chilean Endemic of South America Subalpian belt of the mountain regions of Chili, Argentina South America Evergreen groups, solitary plantings, alleys, living walls vulnerable species 10-24 (usually up to 1.5 m) high-level conical flat flesh-cereal flesh Puncture bump length 5-10 mm slowly growing, well-drained, clay and peat, photophilous plant and AustroCredrus or Austrocédrus garden, is a genus coniferous trees from the cypress family. One of the types of this genus is the Austredrus Chilean. This species is an evergreen tree, which has a conical crown and flat branches. Austrosedrus is a vulnerable species due to improper operation of natural resources and loss of natural habitat. Therefore, its preservation is an important task for protecting biological diversity. This is a tall tree reaching a height of 10 to 24 meters. In culture, its size Usually does not exceed 1.5 m. Its shape of the crown is conical, and the leaves are scaly and are located on the branches in pairs. The fruit of the Austrazedrus is a bump of about 5-10 mm in size. This species is the endemic of South America and grows mainly in the Subalpian belt of the mountainous regions of Chile and Argentina. He prefers moist and well -drained soils, clay and peaty. Austracedrus is a slowly growing plant that requires a large amount of light. It feels best on open areas with good access to sunlight. This makes him a great choice for use in landscape design, for example, for group or single landings, alleys or living walls.|||Agathis araucarium agatic tree is known about 20 species common in North Australia, New Zealand, in Polynesia, Melanesia, on the Malagina Peninsula, the islands of the Malay Archipelago and the Philippines and in New Guinea Australia, there are no decorative decorative wild -growing some species - for example, agatic white (agathis alba), - the wood is cultivated for decorative purposes actively used and is used in shipbuilding, construction, and furniture; some Types are a source of solid resin, known as the tall to 70 trunks in plants, for a significant length-without side branches of 3 m (sometimes up to 9 m) unusual for gymnosperms: leaves with a length of 5 to 18 cm and a width of 1 to 6 cm are usually young pink or reddish, adults-dark green cylindrical nicknames. (male), spherical, less often wide -cylindrical (female) with a length of 2 to 6 cm and up to 1 cm wide (male), with a diameter of 6 to 15 cm (female) is well lend itself to processing, elastic, almost without knots and a slowly growing perennial Agatis - these are just tracing paper from the English and Latin names Agathis. The plant belongs to the Araukariy family, to the genus of agatics, the vital form is a tree. High decorativeness attracts more and more attention to this type. True, not all varieties are suitable for decorating rooms. Growth is very slow. In total, approximately 20 species of agatics are known. Accurate The classification has not yet established, discussions continue. It was precisely established that this is a deciduous plant that does not discard foliage in natural conditions, and the height of the barrel reaches 70 m. The trunks themselves with a diameter of 3 to 9 m resemble a column or pole, a significant part of their length is devoid of side branches and leaves. Agatis has no thorns. Although this is a typical gloomy plant, it produces real leaves. Their length varies from 50 to 180 mm, and width - from 10 to 60 mm. In young The leaves are pink or slightly red, when the tree grows up, the foliage will become dark green.\n\nAgatis's fruit, like a pine tree, is an ordinary bump. These cones are conditionally divided into male, similar to the cylinder, and female, closer to circles. Fruits length from 2 to 6 cm, width up to 1 cm (male), diameter from 6 to 15 cm (female). By the age of 40, the trunk is still low, and its side branches remain thin. The plant reaches the largest size in only 200-300 years. It is so slow Development makes practical application in the economy very rare. It is curious that instead of the usual residents of Listopad, this species makes a “branch -bearing”. In New Caledonia, dwarf specimens are growing, which only occasionally exceed a 9-meter mark.\n\nAgatis bark of all species is completely smooth. Her color can be very different: both slightly gray and reddish-brown colors are not excluded. Bark is often prone to peeling and even exfoliation. After it, the bare smooth sites. In combination with spotting, this only adds visual exoticism. In the upper part, the barrel can be thinner than in the middle, but this is not necessary. The first side branches are visible around the middle in height. The crown is expressive sprawling. It is known that such plants can be found in Australia and New Zealand. However, they also live in:\n\n\n\tPolynesia;\n\tMelanesia;\n\tNew Guinea;\n\tin the Philippines;\n\tisland lands of the Malay archipelago;\n\tIn Malacca.\n\n\nSouth The form of Agatis is known as Kauri. It is now found only in New Zealand. It is worth noting that the fossil remains of such trees are found much further north than they are now found. A similar shoot was discovered even in Eurasia. The already mentioned Kauri can grow only in the warmest areas of New Zealand. There they populate valleys on the North Island. The quality of ventilation of the territory is critical. At first, relatively dense thickets are formed, but competition Only a few specimens that flaunt their trunks withstand.\n\nAgatis is considered a shade -tolerant plant. The drought is not afraid of him. Clay areas, folded from loose soil are preferred. In the summer there should be a temperature of 25-30 degrees, in the winter months 10-20 degrees (however, short cooling to +5, if there are no soil frosts, are safe). They plant Agatis where strong winds will not hurt him. The substrate is loosened. The use of \"family\" helps to increase the chances of rooting soil comments. They are wound up with natural fabric and actively moistened.\n\nLanding is usually performed in early spring. Seeds are recommended to stratify. This procedure is carried out from 90 to 120 days at 15-20 degrees. In some cases, vegetative breeding is practiced, for which air layouts or cuttings are needed. A good stalk has 4 internodes. Frowning is possible if the air is very wet, and the temperature is at the level of 20-25 degrees. Wherever such a tree is grown, It looks gorgeous and cool. It is most advisable to cultivate it on vast open areas, where nothing interferes with the assessment of power and beauty. The plant has very broad prospects in winter gardens. Indoor use is almost unrealistic. Agatis wood is used to build boats and even small ships. More often, however, it is taken for the manufacture of furniture for construction work. Separate varieties give digging (that is, a particularly firm resin that does not contain etheric oils). When processing a tree, knots almost do not cause problems.|||Cydōnia pink aiva tree, shrub grows on the plains in the forests along the edges, in clearing and cutting, along the banks of reservoirs and slopes in the lower belt of the mountains, rising to 1400 m above sea level in nature, the area covers the Caucasus, Transcaucasia and Central Aszia, Dagestan and Turkmenia (Kopetdag). Widely spread and naturalized throughout the Mediterranean, moderate regions of Asia, the southern and central regions of Europe. Cultivated in many areas of Europe (before Scotland and Norway, 63 ° 50 ’s. sh.), North and South Africa, North and South America, Australia and Oceania Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Australia, decorative fruit, decorative cultural, no decorative plant in therapeutic practice use fruits, seeds and leaves of quince; mucus is used in textile production for guiding a gloss on tissue; The water broth can replace the Arabian gum no widespread medium-sized from 1.5 to 4-5 obliquely upwards rising thin, scales-falling on the trunk and old branches are dark gray, reddish-brown or black-brown, smooth; on the young-Burovato-gray; The shoots are gray-green ovoid or oval, sometimes wide-elliptical, less often rounded, whole, spicy or stupid at the top, with a wedge-shaped, less often rounded or slightly heart-shaped base 5-10, up to 12 cm wide, up to 7.5 cm width, naked out-of-green, below from below, grayish from wounded lowers. Part of single, on short felt-frightened pedicels up to 4.5-5 cm in diameter, large pale pink, white or pink false apple with five multi-seeded nests are almost spherical or pear-shaped, often stupid-cut with a diameter of 2.5-3.5 cm in cultural forms of lemon or dark yellow color, sometimes sometimes, sometimes With a reddish unilateral “tan” is very fragrant, small, hard, tough from numerous rocky cells and tart, astringent, sweet cornfield, light yellow or pinkish-yellow, dispersed, with poorly noticeable annual rings, solid, there is no slowly growing spring, summer fruits ripen in September-October prefers deep, loose, fertile and moist soil; The most productive on heavy loams, but on sandy soils, earlier fruit bears well tolerates a haircut for a long time can grow with a lack of moisture or without irrigation by seed breeding (strong dishes are obtained), cuttings, root Almost all old trees with a heart -shaped rot, caused by the fungus of Fomes Fulva; The SCLEROTINIA CYDNIAE fungus affects the leaves, which greatly affects the total size of the tree and its productivity and for the cottage and garden of the quince is a fruit ripening on a tree. People met this tree several thousand years ago, in ancient times it was actively cultivated in Rome and Greece. In the mythology of Aiva, the glory of the main fruit in the garden of the goddess Hea was attributed. Plant It is a modest size of wood or sprawling shrub. In the wild, Aiva rises above the ground by 1.5 and sometimes 5-6 m. The height grown in the garden or the dacha reaches 10 m. The width of the trunk is about 40 cm, it is “dressed” with a thin scales-on-right bark. The old branches and the trunk are covered with a smooth brown bark with black interspersed or brown with red fragments. Young have green shoots with a gray tint, and the bark on them is brownish-gray.\n\nThe branches rise upside down, on They are in order of queue densely growing leaves that have the shape of an oval, eggs, sometimes a circle or a wide ellipse, can be whole -edge, with a dull or sharp tip, with a heart -shaped, rounded or wedge -shaped base. Their surface is naked. The front side is painted in a dark green color, the wrong side is in gray. In length, each sheet stretches for 5-10 cm, in width-7.5 cm. In May-June, when the air warms up to at least +17 degrees, Aiva begins to bloom. This period lasts about 3 weeks. The color of the flowers varies depending on the variety, it can be snow-white, pale pink, pink or have a different bright color.\n\nThey keep up the fruits, as a rule, in September-October. In appearance, they are a false apple with five nests, tightly stuffed with seeds. The shape of the fruit is close to the ball or pear -shaped, often has stupid, weakly expressed ribs. At first, the fetus is covered with a felt fluff, then it is made solid and without roughness. The seeds are red-brown, look like apple. Diameter The fruits of the wild quince are small-2.5-3.5 cm, in a cultural plant it reaches 15 cm. The color of the fruit is determined by the variety, the brightness of the color is in close connection with the degree of maturity. Tasters characterize the taste of many varieties of quince as sweet, tart, astringent. The aroma of fruits resembles lemon, sometimes it can be similar to the smell of tropical fruits. The pulp is hard, not juicy enough, consists of many rocky cells. The chemical composition is generously endowed with minerals, essential oils, acids, fructose, pectins, vitamins of group B, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, calcium, vitamin A, manganese and vitamin C. The first to grow quince of Caucasus, Transcaucasia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan. Then she fell into Greece, Australia, South and North Africa, Oceania, North and South America, Rome. It is cultivated in many European regions (before Norway and Scotland, 63 ° 50 's.). Among the most famous varieties of quince, biologists identify The following.\n\n\n\tChinese. This species is also called a lemonnik, East Asia is considered its homeland. It is a semi-earned, deciduous tree, rises above the ground by 3-6 m. Autumn sometimes changes the coloring of foliage from green to ally, yellow, red. An adult plant has an interesting feature: the bark moves away from the barrel, and it is made similar to a mosaic of brown, ashy, emerald tones. Flowers in this variety are pale pink, flowering starts in early April and ends in the second decade of May. Volumetric fruits ripen on the twigs, which often weigh up to one and a half kilograms. He feels comfortably in the flat edges or at the edge of the forest, in the meadow, on the shores of lakes and rivers, on the cuts, near the foot of the mountains. The soil prefers a deep, with a thick fertile layer, loose. The plant can be observed in a marshy area, in regions where a chernozem, sand, red -headed, alluvial type of soil is found. It is well adapted to salty earth. Abundant The crop brings on heavy loams.\n\nHe safely adjacent to Kizil, Oak, Muskula, Rosehip, Hawthorn. A prerequisite for harmonious vegetation of a tree is heat. Normal for culture is the temperature of +7 ... +15 ° C. Even light frosts (- 1.1 ° C) can cause significant damage to the perennial. For planting, gardeners choose seedlings aged 1-2 years. The optimal time of the procedure is the first spring weeks (before the kidneys blossom), but it is allowed to plant in the fall, 30 days before frost. The day before, a hole is digged with a size of 50x50 cm. If there are many plants, there is an interval of 1 m between them. When Ivas immerses in the fossa, the root neck is not deepened. The soil in the trunk circle is tamped, the seedling is generously watered. Caring for culture implies systematic irrigation, top dressing, pruning, and preparation for winter.\n\nMoisten the perennial as necessary (watching the weather), approximately 1 time per month. After watering, specialists It is advised to mulch the ground with peat crumbs or sawdust. Three times a season, quince is pampering with nutrients. In the spring, fertilizer should be saturated with nitrogen, after flowering and harvesting, phosphorus and potassium solutions should be prepared. From time to time they resort to the loosening of the soil and cleaning it from weed grass.\n\nBefore the beginnings of the juice (in the spring), the tree is cut. Firing off injured, unhealthy, frozen, dry and very old branches is required. In standard varieties, all growing Below vaccine shoots. At the age of five, a formative pruning is performed, getting rid of branches that stretch horizontally in the ground or strictly vertically. Decorative varieties of quince (such as Japanese) appear in the improvement of cottages and personal plots. Fruit varieties are not used in this quality. The plant pleases the eye in single and group plantings. Aiva will transform a low fence, a curb, a Japanese kindergarten, an alpine hill, is suitable for a hedge. She is in a mixborder appropriate in place of the upper or middle tiers. It is good at the walls of buildings on a special support, against the background of brick - white or red. If the shoots of a perennial crease, he will miraculously decorate the paths in the garden.\n\nThe plant not only transforms the place, but also benefits, for example, on the alpine hill, it will protect the slope from showing. Great culture and vaccinated on the stem. A mountain ash or hawthorn can act as a bon. It looks charming surrounded by lemon-yellow daffodils, white tulips, Step-me-not, yellow-violet violets, bells, blue Veronica, Caucasian arabis.\n\nAmazing next to Weigel, yellow or red currants, barberry, forzia, decorative plum, flowering white flowers with Irga, Magonia Padubolitny, boxwood. The win -win decorative quince looks in the tub. It will also make up a delightful composition with coniferous species of short stature (mountain pine, juniper, touis). When cultivating plants using the bonsai technique for a while Winter colds are placed in the room, and in the summer, along with the pot, it is transferred to the front door to the dwelling. The farm massively uses the wood of quince. According to the description, it is moderately firm, hardened, with scattered vessels and barely distinguishable annual rings, is slightly painted in a yellow or yellow-pink tone and polished without problems. In addition, in the textile industry, mucus from the seeds of the plant is allowed to put shine on tissue. Aiva is recognized as one of the most ancient fruiting Plants, its history has about 4 millennia.\n\tThe largest number of these fruits in the world is grown by Türkiye, Turkish roots can be traced in every 5th fetus.\n\tThere is not a single plant, a kinship.\n\t10% of the mass of the fetus is sugar.\n\tAiva easily withstands a long -term growth in the soil barely moistened with water and is not afraid of excessive moisture (for example, during the flood period).\n\tThe weight of the fruit is surprising, sometimes it reaches 2 kg.\n\tAiva Dichka gives much more meager The crop compared to the cultural form, fruits are often a little and they are small.\n\tFruit seeds are 20% of mucus.\n\tThe poets of ancient Greece called the word \"quince\" teenage breasts.\n\tThe culture has found extensive use in medicine, and, in addition to fruits, leaves and seeds are also used.\n\tThe fruit in appearance can simultaneously resemble both an apple and a pear.\n\tThe peoples of the Mediterranean considered Aiva a symbol of fertility and love.\n\tThe tree perfectly tolerates the haircut, so farmers often replace it fence.\n\tThe culture is loved to show as a deciduous sample Bonsai (miniature tree).\n\tAiva is added to the best white wines.\n\tTranslated from the Portuguese language, the word \"marmalade\" is interpreted as \"puree from quince.\"\n\tMany dishes of Armenian cuisine cannot do without petals of a flowering tree.\n\tIn honor of this perennial, the Azerbaijani dance of Aivaguli is named.|||AKEBIA, chocolate vine of lardizabal acybium Lianovodic Plant Homeland of Akebia - East Asia (China, Korea and Japan) deciduous evergreen decorative cultural no flesh and skin of fruits (seeds) are edible, in East Asia they are eaten; In the spring, in Japan, the shoots and kidneys of acubia are eaten, in the fall its seeds are consumed in raw form, or slightly fried, first filling Miso and chicken with minced meat; From the leaves, the drink is brewed no medium -sized up to 4 long openwork at the same time Male and female flowers are bloomed with purple or reddish-violet light chocolate and large, there are no rapidly growing spring, abundant perennial areas are suitable for fruitful loamy grounds with low acidity and in partial shade in the middle lane freezes even if there is a shelter and a garden of akebia for a summer residence and garden in height up to 7 m, and in good conditions and without formation - 10 m. Grow a bushy -like vine in the middle lane Russia is no more complicated than Clematis, so it is increasingly gaining popularity among landscape designers and gardeners. Annually, Akebia adds to growth to three meters. At the same time, it is cut at the right level so that there is no need for a transplant due to a strongly developed root system.\n\nFeatures that lovers of new means need to know about in the decorative design of the site:\n\n\n\tLiana is considered evergreen, but this is only partially true, in the southern regions - where it is cold, it is for the winter drops the leaves;\n\tFlowering-from the middle of summer (according to other sources-May-June, but it depends on the region of residence of the gardener), can bear fruit, but in temperate climate does this rarely;\n\tThe fruits are not only tasty, but also useful, heal digestion, resemble raspberries;\n\tIt is divided into five and three -leaf, in Russia you can grow only the first, no matter what sellers of seedlings say;\n\tIt will be possible to get decorative flowering of lilac color to southerners, residents of the middle lane can enjoy red flowers.\n\n\nOpinions regarding belonging to vegetables and fruits diverge due to the double taste of fruits resembling small bananas, but not yellow, but lilac. Near the seeds - the pulp with the taste of raspberries, closer to the peel resembles a cucumber. Straveless fertility - one flower can give several fruits cracking during ripening. The Lardisabal family mainly includes shrubs, curly or creeping, and even one species (deenea) erect. They are united by software several signs:\n\n\n\tcomplex, outlower leaves with paired appendages at the cuttings (expressed differently, sometimes fall in the season);\n\tmulti-floor flowers collected in the hand, less often-single, with a simple perianth in an amount of 3-6 pieces;\n\tA common feature is 6 stamens, but there are a different number of nectarians, pestlers and fruiting;\n\tjuicy, with a pleasant smell, the fruits are similar to berries, but are revealed when ripening;\n\tThe seeds are similar: the endosperm is large, and the embryo is small, direct shape.\n\n\nOpinions about The number of varieties diverge, call 5, 6, and sometimes 9. Akebia simply did not gain the popularity that it is worthy, but in America and Australia it is already growing without fruiting. East Asia, mainly China, Japan and Korea - places for the spread of a bushy -like vine. There it bears fruit, widely eaten. There are many culinary recipes in combination with other products inherent in the food mentality. In other cases:\n\n\n\tFive -lobed or five acubia (name It came from the shape of the leaves, somewhat reminiscent of the human palm) feels well in the Crimea and in the Caucasus, but with some efforts it is also grown in the middle lane;\n\tTo date, adapted on other continents: in North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand;\n\tIt is often grown in vazons and cleaned for the winter in the room, but it is troublesome-Liana needs periodic transplant due to the formation of a powerful root system. Three -leafy (leaves at the beginning The season of a bronze shade, and then turn green) bloomed burgundy, and the fruits of a lilac-pound shade. It grows slower and is more demanding on natural conditions.\n\tLong -flowered grows in Taiwan, it has small foliage and long purple inflorescences.\n\tThe unpretentiousness of climatic conditions and inconsistency in leaving led to the widespread spread of five -line acebia. AKEBIA Quintata, with its complex leathery leaves and abundant flowering (it is found either red or dark purple)- The most famous species. The open sun, even in a cold climate, is not the most suitable condition for a comfortable growth of acubia. She prefers the scattered light, in the wild grows under the trees. However, given the local climatic realities, she still needs to provide sufficient lighting if the designer of the garden or site wants to get decorative abundant flowering. This is necessary:\n\n\n\thidden from the cold wind, but the wet corner (so that the buds do not fall with returning frosts);\n\tMulching the soil to preserve moisture (the plant transfers only short -term drought, but at the same time experiences stress);\n\tFree space and conditions for growth, with the formation of the support, are strong enough to withstand the pressure of actively growing shoots.\n\n\nAs a support, you can use large trees. The soil is preferred slightly acidic or neutral, although some sources states that only permanent humidity in the surface is important to Liana. The root system, and it is not particularly demanding on the composition of the soil. Bus -like liana has amazing winter hardiness, withstands a lowering to -20 ° C. Buying a certain variety, you need to study the description from the manufacturer. Sometimes beneficial properties are added in the process of selection, but can be sacrificed by decorativeness.\n\nYou can get this worthy instance of the collection in late spring or early autumn. For planting, you need:\n\n\n\thole in size 0.5x0.5 m in carefully selected place;\n\tThe drainage layer at the bottom is gravel, any of the usual ones with medium sizes;\n\tbait from a mixture of a garden substrate with organic fertilizers and peat;\n\tFixing in a given direction on an already prepared strong support.\n\n\nMulching of the trunk circle is a great way not to take care of regular watering, you can carry out abundant moisturizing with urgent necessity. The material of the supports does not matter, but the lattice is not very desirable. Akebia is sheltered for the winter in Moderate climate, gardener will be difficult to unhook shoots. Pruning is sanitary, but you can join annually to the level of the soil one over one too active run. The landscape designer has unlimited spaces for activity. The owner of a small site can simply disguise with the help of this beautiful vines a bare unattractive walls, a dull fence, a trunk of an old tree. The landscape artists use it for vertical decor, design arches, arbors and pergola, combine with other curly cultures. An excellent combination will be acebia in the composition with the valley, Heyera, and soil trendy plants. Rhododendron and peonies, honeysuckle, climbing roses, clematis are beautiful neighbors for this exotic and beautiful guest.\n\nExperiment with curly plants can be endlessly. At the disposal of the gardener there are supports made by the factory way created by yourself. There is always a shaded corner and a place that needs to be given decorativeness on the site.|||Blighia sapida sapinda bliga aka tree Homeland Aki - West Africa. He was brought to Yamaiku and later spread to Central America, the Antilles and Bahamas. Single trees are also found in Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia and Suriname Africa Little Farm Cultural Fruit, no flesh of the fruits can eat raw, but on Jamaica it is usually boiled with saline sida or hat, in Africa, Aki is added to the soup or fried in oil; In Western Africa Green fruits are used as soap the fruits of aka are poisonous (contain hypoglitsin) until they open naturally; Seeds are always poisonous, in them the concentration of hypoglitsin is 2-3 times more and a tall to 10-12 almost smooth gray elliptical 15-30 cm long pear-shaped fruit; outwardly resembles a peach 7-10 cm long red-yellow creamy and a sweet pulp, like a walnut, a fast-growing perennial of aki is a culture belonging to the family Sapinde and the family of Blizh. The tree is deciduous, fruit. The birthplace of Bligy is tasty is West Africa. The culture was now a leading exporter of the fruit, the Yamaika, which is now in the 17th century, thanks to William Blaya - a sailor whose hobby was to collect non -standard cultures. It was he who took out several seedlings from their natural habitat. Later, bliga spread through several continents. Aki is a small culture. At the best Woods grow to 10-12 m, its crown is voluminous, formed from elliptical large foliage. The length of each sheet plate is about 15-30 cm. The surface of the foliage is shiny, the color is dark emorus. The lower part of the leaf is matte, with a beautiful ornament of veins. The bark on the tree is smooth, gray.\n\nDuring the flowering period, bisexual white-green flowers are formed on a tree. They themselves are tiny, but the inflorescences consisting of them have impressive dimensions. Aki's fruits Pir-shaped, in appearance, somewhat reminiscent of peaches. The length of the fruit is 7-10 cm, its color is attractive, red-yellow. Before ripening, the fruits are green. The pulp of the ripe fruit of aka has a delicate cream tint. Its taste is quite difficult, it does not have pronounced notes of sweets, acids or bitterness. However, those who have tried this product claim that it taste extremely similar to ordinary walnuts. Aki grows in Central America, in Bagams, in the Antilles. So many Plantations are concentrated on Jamaica. Occasionally, such trees can be found in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador. But there, the plant is mainly used for decorative, and not for food purposes. Bligy delicious prefers a warm tropical climate. Trees are comfortable with temperature indicators of +25 ... +30 degrees. They plant them in well -lit places, you can completely open, because the wind is not afraid of the wind. The air at the place of growth of aka should always be quite moist.\n\nPlant Prefers neutral and loose soils, well -drained, but not dry. It feels good in sandy, loamy substrates, lands enriched with organic matter. At the same time, local gardeners are trying to avoid high groundwater.\n\nIn Russia, you can also grow a tree, but only as a dwarf indoor culture. The vegetation should be in the warmest room of the house. Of course, the temperature of the +30 will be difficult to provide for her, so you can dwell on the indicators in +22 ... +25 degrees. Humidity is held in the range of 65-70%.\n\nAki is grown only by means of seeds, if you are lucky to get them. This is associated with certain difficulties, since in most countries the import of AKI is prohibited. Seeds sprout only in humus ground and at a temperature of +30 degrees, so for them for the first time they organize greenhouses made of plastic bags. Later, the tree can be planted in a typical soil for him. He also suits him for fruit trees. Described The plant is quite demanding on watering, so the Earth must be constantly maintained in a moisture. At the same time, it is strictly forbidden to fill in culture, otherwise then you will have to transplant. Water the aks with warm water, preferably rain. The strong stiffness of the fluid fluid is poorly tolerated.\n\nYou can feed the culture with a weak solution of mullein, but if its aromas confuse, it is permissible to use the complex mineral compositions of the universal format. Their It is enough to enter only a couple of times, for example, in spring and summer. In general, it is worth noting that Aki does not particularly need top dressing.\n\nFrom time to time, the soil in the pot is loosened with a fork to let more oxygen inside. Daily foliage is sprayed from the sprayer, it is best to do it in the evening. They also monitor the appearance of culture, remove dried and yellowed leaves. The transplant is carried out as necessary, when the plant develops its pot. In Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and in Aki trees grow some other states not for food, but in order to decorate the gardens. They fit perfectly into local landscapes, emphasizing their flavor.\n\nAki is excellently combined with stones, bamboo, tropical plants. Most often, it is planted in tier gardens, where plants are located levels, like the jungle. Often, such trees are placed near reservoirs, in recreation areas, equipped with wicker furniture and hammocks, next to gazebos in the form of huts or canopies. The fruit of aki Pretty useful. So, it contains large quantities, vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals. Fruits have an antioxidant property, prevent aging, and increase the body's immunity. They remove toxins, normalize the work of the heart and blood vessels, improve vision. They also normalize the work of the stomach and intestines.\n\nFruits of this type are often consumed in cooking. For example, in Africa, fruit pulp can be placed in soups or fry, and on a pit it is boiled together with Heck or Sayda. Also here they can be fried with sugar and salt, served with pancakes. From the product you can make casseroles, jam, omelettes, pies. Another is well suitable for various meat and fish dishes. We will analyze several remarkable moments associated with this amazing fruit.\n\n\n\tJamaica, as already mentioned, is the main exporter of Aki. Every year, such products allows the local industry to earn about $ 13 million. Fruits enter the market in the market canned format.\n\tTourists who come to the places where AKI is allowed to use, claim that the most delicious dish that they had to try is this fruit in combination with a plague.\n\tThe poison, which some local fish poison the fish to facilitate the catch, is prohibited at the legislative level. There are simply dangerous water inhabitants caught, but this, however, does not stop anyone.\n\tAki enters at the time of fruiting by 4 after planting. The fees are carried out twice a year: from the middle Winter for March, as well as from the start of summer to its end. Only those fruits that have been revealed naturally are allowed to collect.\n\tThe name \"Blizh\" was given to a tree in honor of its discoverer, William Blya. But the name \"Aki\" came from the dialect of ChVI from the words of Akye Fufo.|||Jidda, Pshat, Elaeagnus Umbellata Buckwheat sucker Loch Umbrella East Asia, Japan, China is leaf-down, evergreen fruit, decorative groups, loners, decoration of the lawn fresh food, processing for jelly, jams or centuries and a rare, powerful wide-and-distributed bushes 2.5 Medium-sized long, drooping, flexible lanceolate 8-9 dysfunges 0.8 cm are unripe greenish-silver, with fully maturation of ruby-scarlet rugging with brown points and spring in On September, an unfriendly perennial is undemanding in the spring, in the south and autumn during the drought period, a sanitary is necessary - every year it is necessarily in the central part of Russia, it is not necessary in the south by root offspring, seeds, cuttings and akigumi is also known as Jidd and Psat.

The main agrotechnical measures to care for the care of shrubs.\n\n\n\tManual watering is not needed by culture, especially in cases where it already grows near water. Only recently planted bushes or those that suffer from a long and strong drought are irrigated.\n\tIf the growth occurs on rich soil, the amorphus does not need to fertilize. However, in poor with nutrients, the soil must be added 1 time in 5 years to dry mineral top dressing when digging the earth under the bush.\n\tIn spring, deformed, dry and frozen shoots are cut off, which is quite enough. If The plant began to fade, slow down in growth, it is cut off \"on a stump\", rejuvenating.\n\tIn the winter, the roots of the amorphs are densely mulched in organic materials, and the twigs are bent to the ground and thrown with a spruce gun. The shrub under consideration can be found in the city. They make parks and squares, territories near hospitals, schools, kindergartens. In the south, such vegetation is often observed near sanatoriums, hotels. But it is quite possible to grow amorphous on your own area.

All subspecies are very poisonous to produce veneer, especially the anchar is poisonous (antiaris toxicaria lesch.), Whose juice poison arrows and cause arrows and evoke The smallest fears widespread 40 high -rise simple, surrounded by a gorgeous wolf, dense small complex or prefabricated The average growth rate is a perennial anchar - an evergreen deciduous plant, the subspecies of which are poisonous. It is the juice of this plant that natives process the ends of their arrows. This plant is widespread, so it causes the smallest fears of disappearance. Anchar is characterized by a slender barrel, can reach a height and 40 meters. The crown in adult trees forms a rounded shape. The described plant refers to the family of the tutovs, its closest relatives from a botanical point of view are ficus and mulberry. All subspecies of the described plants grow in the East Indies and on the Malay archipelago. The described plant usually requires a lot of sunlight, so it is useful to it any place where the anchar can be in the sun almost the whole day. Tropical plants of this species are accustomed to a large amount of water, but they also love well -drained soil. It is usually advised to carry out the watering of Anchara when the upper surface of the soil is already dry. It is better to put the hose nearby and slightly Open the crane. The soil should be saturated with high quality to deep layers.\n\nThe key component of the successful cultivation of Anchar is no frost. This plant does not tolerate low temperatures, so they are advised to plant a tree in the south and be sure to cover it with agromaterial for the winter. Low temperatures in winter will necessarily lead to damage to the roots and leave damage to the shoots. The first thing to do when planting this tree is to improve the quality of the soil. Pouring rains and excessive use, Perhaps the soil was exhausted, and it became poor on nutrients. Moreover, it is necessary to check that the site does not contain the remaining roots from other trees. Digging the hole with a depth of at least 15 cm, add the material that will facilitate and enrich the soil, for example, compost.\n\nIn this case, the sand will help to organize the correct drainage, which can be taken from the riverbed, old sawdust, coconut fiber, garden soil or pre -mixed potted soil. Mix any well Their options with the soil, which is available on the site, in the ratio - approximately 2 parts of the new material to one part of the old.\n\nAnchar will not grow in dense, heavy and too wet soil. When planting in open ground to the bottom of the pit, they also advise pouring a mixture also to pour out:\n\n\n\t1 part of perlite or vermiculite;\n\t1 part of the sand;\n\t1 part peat.\n\n\nSome gardeners recommend adding gated lime, which must be sprinkled a month before planting the plant. It reduces acidity and helps split clay. Strong poison is made from the juice of this plant during distillation, but the Bennett subspecies fibers are used to produce bags. The fruits of the anchair contain a good dye. The wood is suitable for the manufacture of veneer, which is very in demand in the furniture industry. If we study the history of the described plant, then in the past it was called the \"tree of death.\" Such an opinion about the plant was created by Botanik Rumpf, who was engaged in his research activities in the middle of the XVIII century. He was sent to the colony to the natives to find out from which plants they get their poison. It took Botanik as long as 15 years to provide his governor for genuine information.\n\nRumpf wrote about Anyar in sufficient detail, noting in his work that under this tree there is no other plants, and the soil is barren and looks like charred. This tree is so poisonous that even the birds who decided to sit on the branches of this tree fall, breathing in poisoned air. Neither the beast nor the person dares to approach Anchar. In fact, such information about the plant was too exaggerated. A lot of time passed, while another scientist dared to study this tree in more detail.|||Arazá, eugēnia stipitāta myrtle Eugene (Eugenia) araza Tropical tree, subequatorial equatorial and tropical forests of the Amazonian part of Brazil, East Peru, East Ecuador South America Cultural, wild juices, non -alcoholic drinks, ice cream, fruit preservation. 2-4.5 numerous, drooping, growing directly from the base, without a clearly expressed conductor, simple oval length 6-18, width 3.5-9.5 is smooth from above, light, lowered from below, below, from below Light green with 5 petals and numerous long petals with thick brushes are rounded, 2-12 cm with a berry weighing 50-750 grams, first green, mature or orange-yellow, matte skin, velvety, 1 mm thick, pulp pulp, juicy, soft berry sphere Up to 12 cm, the brilliant yellow yellow with several large oblong seeds and very sour is tolerant of acidified soils; grows in well -drained area growing on Light terrain withstands a two -month drought only with seeds germining from 2 to 6 months of Araz, also known as Arazá, or Eugēnia Stipitāta, is a tropical tree from the Mirtov family.

The plant is common in the dry areas of the northern coast of South America (Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala) and the West Indestan Islands. It is also cultivated within the natural area and in India, a deciduous elevated decorative cultural, wild -growing no for therapeutic purposes is used by wood; The decoction of wood and tincture of resin are used for rheumatism and gout; Bakout is used in Shipbuilding as bearings of rowing shafts Pubulable species rare tall, medium-sized from 6 to 10 small 2.5-3 cm long and 2 cm width, leathery mental an umbrella pale blue box with black seeds of bright yellow-orange very heavy (sinking in water, since 1 dm³ of its woods weighs 1420 g), unable to split; gray-green to black-green color, when heated, it smells pleasantly; taste Small slowly growing spring perennial The botanical name of this species is Guaicum Officinale. It is also called a bacout tree. The plant belongs to the genus of the Gvyakum of the Parnial -Leafer family. The life form of such a plant is predictably woody. On the trees, foliage develops, which is not discarded for the winter. There are both cultural and wild copies of the bacout.\n\nThe height of such a tree is from 6 to 10 m. It does not have any lianide forms, there are completely no spikes. The length of the leaves is from 25 to 30 mm, and width is on average 20 mm. For the sheet, the skin skin is typical, and leaves are placed on the plant according to the opposite scheme.\n\nThe composition of the flowers stand out 5 petals. Inflorescences are apical umbrellas. Each flower is painted in a pale blue tone.\n\nThe fruit of the bacout is a bright box of yellow-orange. Inside it contains black seeds. An important feature of the gvayak tree is extremely heavy wood, which is drowning in water, since 1 cubic meter. Fresh DM has a mass of 1.42 kg. This wood cannot split, and it varies the color; There are gray-green, black and green options, and transitional tones. The wood mass in the heated state emits a pleasant smell, which is associated with the impressive content of resins. Gweeted tree comes from dry areas in the north of South America. It can be found mainly in Colombia, Venezuela and Guatemala. And also the plant settled in the West India Islands, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica. The presence in Honduras was noted. Cultural trees are found both in the Latin American area and in India. Bakout does not just give especially strong and persistent wood. This expresses his ability to adapt to very rigid parameters of the external environment. Gvayak trees grow on meager soils covered with stone or sand, as well as in arid areas. If the situation is sharply unfavorable, the metabolism is artificially inhibited. Leaf skin is another adaptive mechanism to avoid excessive evaporation of moisture in dry periods.\n\nThe tropical guest, of course, must be provided with continuous heat - from 23 to 25 degrees. Bright, but at the same time scattered light and the exclusion of contact with cold air are very important. The choice of soil type is not very fundamental. Continuing the theme of the soil, it is worth emphasizing that bacout can be planted in:\n\n\n\tloam;\n\tChernozems;\n\tSupri;\n\tForest soil.\n\n\nHowever, it will be possible to change the container only in the first years of development, and therefore it is better to immediately think about what to do More competitive. It will take several years, and the only opportunity for breeders will be to replace the top level of the substrate. Even such a transshipment should go with the preservation of the soil coma.\n\nSome prepare the soil mixture on their own. It must be made up of various components, the ratio between which varies intuitively. In addition to peat, put the river sand of a large fraction, coniferous soil, humus, turf and leaf soil. All this is flavored with additives, which loosen the soil and stimulate plant development:\n\n\n\tsphagnum;\n\tcrushed cedar bark;\n\tsapropel;\n\tsphagnum;\n\tcrumbled polystyrene foam;\n\tvermiculite;\n\tagricultural vehicle.\n\n\nOf course, you do not need to strive to use, in general, all additives to improve the substrate. Its structure should be optimal, and not composed of any chaos. Before using the soil, you need to make sure that it is sufficiently loose, the ability to absorb water and pass air. A good solution for those who wish To simplify your life will be a finished mixture for indoor large -scale lamps. It is impossible to use long -lying substrates or soil from greenhouses, but it is impossible to do without a drainage layer. The high strength of the bacout allows you to use it as a raw material for bearings of rowing shafts in river and sea vessels. Such bearings are no less reliable than steel or copper. The shavings or crushed wood is cooled in water or distilled by a dry way to obtain resin. In the past, such a resin It was used as an indicator of the presence of hemoglobin.\n\nFor a long time, Bakout served as a source of raw materials for drugs, but then, when much more effective medicines appeared, he came down from the stage in this capacity. However, its wood continues to be relevant material, and not only in shipbuilding. Machine builders value it, choose it for the production of templates and turning products.\n\nChoosing balls and bowling melts, you can also stumble upon bacout products. This tree is still taken for manufacturing of blocks, sts and pestlers of culinary or laboratory purposes. It is also suitable for obtaining knife handles. Finally, a bacout veneer in the production of furniture is periodically found.|||Beckhausia, Backhousia Mirchtovy Bakkhusia Lemonous-Fool Wood, Endemic Queensland, New South Wales Tropical Equatorial and Tropical Forests Australia Australia, Everlandly Border, Contained Decorative, Indoor Medicine, Fettlement, Food, Cosmetology, Cosmetology 5-25 High-tone about 2 lanceolate oval-core 3-12 lengths, 1-6 width of the lower parts are often covered with hairs.

Rare high-rise have a very strong and light wood, the average dry density of which is 120-160 kg/m³ and the rapidly growing perennial Ochroma Pyramidale (mallow family) is the scientific name for this tree. Balza trees grow very quickly. 6 months after the germination of balce reaches about 2.5 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height. After 6-10 years, the plant is ready for pruning, reaching a height of 15 to 20 meters. Balsa is a deciduous or evergreen plant with a smooth gray-white bark, reaching about 40 m in height.\n\nThe sheet of balce is similar in shape to grape, only much more. When the tree is young, these leaves reach 10 cm across. As the plants grow up, they are becoming more and more. Large leaves are weakly palmate, reach 30-40 cm in diameter.\n\nBalsa is one of the few trees in the jungle, which has a simple shape of the leaves. This fact is already distinguishing this plant among others.\n\nThe fruits of the described tree are green capsules with cotton threads called hoods that surround the seeds. Balsa comes from Central America and the western coast of South America. Balsa needs warm climate with a large amount of precipitation and good drainage in the ground. For this reason, large thickets of the described Plants usually appear on hills between tropical rivers. In Ecuador, ideal geography and climate for growing balm trees. The seeds of this tree are dispelled through the air, as they have thin bundles of fluff associated with the seed itself, which are transferred by the wind.\n\nThe described plants do not grow in the shade. It is noteworthy that the rapid development of trees is noticeable during the first 5 years of their life.\n\nWhen planting a seedling of balsa on the site, it is necessary to provide for a tree in The future was enough sun and free space. Under the canopy of other trees, a young plant will most likely die.\n\nAs for watering, it should be regular, especially if the summer turned out to be hot and dry. Do not forget that Balsa is used to growing in the tropics, where it is very wet, but there are no swamps. Closed to these conditions allow you to grow a beautiful tropical tree on their site. Balse's natural house is in an open forest, so it looks especially beautiful in any natural or semi -nested garden. Nearby, deciduous trees or evergreen conifers will look good.\n\nYou can use the balsa as an accent on the site and land separately to the side of the garden, where you need to close a large area. This is an ideal companion and an addition to the splendor of bright colors of rhododendrons, as well as the perfect background for thickets of azalia. The wood of the described tree is a light, well -processed material that is used to create various products. She quickly found its application in industry as the easiest material for glider and sea containers.\n\nIt can be easily processed using standard equipment and twisted into various forms without loss of strength, which makes the balsa wood with a great choice for both fans and experts.\n\nThis name was obtained due to the fact that the material has excellent buoyancy. Слово «бальса» происходит из испанского языка и означает «плот». Nothing Amazing, because in the territory of Central America, where the tree grows, the Spanish language is common to everyone.\n\nFor centuries, people did not resort to the use of knives in the processing of this wood for centuries. It is less dense than some other similar ones, therefore it is used in rescue vests, fishing tackle and floating agents. The wood of the described plant is also used for the manufacture of smooth surf boards.\n\nВ своем плавании на плоту «Кон-Тики» в 1947 For the year, the Norwegian traveler Tour Heyerdal tried to prove that our ancestors traveled from Peru to Polynesia on thin ships made of balce.\n\nThe main case of an independently organized raft was from approximately 9 logs of this tree with a length of 10 to 14 meters. To bind the material, stump ropes were used. Ecuador in South America is the main supplier of this material. Local farmers consider Balce a pest plant.\n\nDuring the First World War The war of the United States Army used a balm instead of a traffic jam. This material has become a standard component used in light structures.\n\nThe core of the described tree is gradually destroyed, like the surface layer, after 10 years. Typically, only one or two woods of the described species germinate per 1 AK (0.4 ha), thus, many workers are required to collect the material. The trunks are demolished in a stream and are delivered by water to the production plant, and then crossed through the Atlantic to United States.\n\nThis wood contains an amazingly large amount of water, which makes it difficult to transport through the air.\n\nBalse wood should be dried for at least two weeks before it becomes suitable for commercial production. This procedure makes the material easy. Only after drying it is cut into strips or round bars. It has grain, so the buyer should know exactly which option will be needed based on their needs.\n\nMany people are familiar with the purchased In the store with miniature toy aircraft from balm. Such a product makes it easy to understand how fragile it can be.\n\nBalsa is considered one of the lightest wood. It is extremely soft and elastic, with a rough and open texture. Despite the fact that this is one of the lightest wood, it is considered one of the most durable.|||Adansonia digitata mallow adansonia baobab tree Tropical zone tropical tropical oreclog and savannah tropical Africa and Australia Africa, Australia Listen-based decorative wild-growing no, almost any part of Baobab has the use of the most careful estimates of Bababab lives at a maximum of about one thousand years of no Highly 18-25 years Usually hollow or hollow, staggered inside a thick 8 5-7-tiring with five petals and purple stamens, on hanging pedicels; They are opened closer to the evening and live only one night, attracting the aroma of pollinating wings up to 20 cm on the diamond, large white resembles cucumbers or melons covered with a thick shaggy peel and a sour soft autumn, there is no slowly growing autumn, winter perennial baobabs is susceptible to fungal diseases, a long-standing tree, very thick and very thick and very thick and very thick Unusual, they will learn about him at an early age from children's encyclopedias.

Under the thick shell with a pile there is powdery pulp, it tastes sour, with many small seeds. Adansonia occupies the northwestern territories of Australia, those zones whose climate is similar to the savannah of Africa. Individual species are common in the western and northern parts of Madagascar and Almost throughout the African savannah. The Madagascar Baobab Aborigines are considered a sacred tree. They endow it with the forces by the forces, are sure that at least one such tree should grow in every village.\n\nFinally, Baobab is a source of food and water for both animals and people. For example, elephants in Africa actually love to eat baobabs entirely. And the pulp of fruits is a treat for monkeys. That is why this tree is often called monkey bread. There are several types in nature Adansonia. For example, the adanson is palmated - this is the well -known African baobab. Only he has snow -white suspended flowers. And the fruits of this species can be oval, round and even ovoid. The birthplace of the tree is the half -succeed of sugar. Adansonium is a succulent that concentrates water well in its own fleshy tissues. All the conditions in which a baobab grows in a natural environment and contribute to its survival. This is hot weather with arid periods, impoverished Soil: for Baobab, a natural context of growth and development. Widely -faced breeds with a thick crown would not have survived here. The baobabs are so “smart” that the droughts are reduced at the time, and the trunks are literally blown away, and the leaves fall - the tree needs to be survived.\n\nThe accumulated moisture is used, which the tree begins to spend smartly. When the rainy season comes, the process of accumulation of moisture will begin again, the tree will swell. All parts of the tree are rich in moisture, and leaflets, flesh of fruits and bark can be eaten. From soft bark The tree makes a seasoning that is very popular in those places where baobabs grow. The ash is used as an antiseptic, as an anesthesia and anti -inflammatory. Tsins and baskets are weaving from the fibers of the bast, durable fishing nets are made, ropes and threads are made. Europeans make paper from this part of the bark.\n\nFresh baobab leaves can be used in salads and soups, you can extinguish and bake them. And the twigs of wood can even pickle and also add to a variety of dishes. If Dry the leaves and shoots, then you can then make tinctures that are used to treat inflammatory processes. And even Baobaba flower pollen is taken into circulation, it goes like raw materials for cooking glue and soap.\n\nThe flesh of the fruits of the tree is also edible, it is light-cream, very similar to pumpkin gutters, and the aroma is similar to ginger. It is useful and saturated with valuable elements. You can eat fruits raw, or you can slows down. As well as the pulp is often dried, crushed to the state of the powder, and do something on its basis Very similar to a ginger drink.\n\nRaw seeds can be eaten in the same way as sunflower seeds. Dried seeds can be finely grind, and make a coffee drink. Fruits are often eaten as a remedy that eliminates overwork, they are very satisfying (no worse than bread). The hard shell of the fruits is also used, only as dishes - half of the fruits can be used as bowls. From ash you can make a tool for strengthening hair. The name baobab is more common than more official Adansonia. So the tree is named after the scientist Michel Adanson, who described an amazing plant.\n\nInterestingly, the baobab bark is refractory, and even if the tree is burned, it does not stop growth. Even if the tree is tie to the ground, it lives, the main thing is that the roots survive. Growing and developing in a horizontal position is the superpower of the baobabs.\n\nThe root system lies very deeply, taking the entire space. And although the roots of the tree are not at all shadow, nothing is growing under them, Even grass and small shrubs. Root shoots take all the food, simply leaving no chance of another flora."

        "summary": "Abélia, Vesálea Honeysuckle Abelia Brush mainly in East Asia (from Japan to the west to the Himalayas) Eurasia in the south of the Primorsky Territory, deciduous, evergreen decorative cultural does not value the elegant appearance of the bushes and prolonged flowering a widespread medium -sized from 1.5 to 2.5 m (sometimes up to 6 m) from 1.5 up to 2.5 m (sometimes up to 6 m) oval with a pointed apex, shiny opposite, usually dark green tubular or funnel-shaped, five-lobed The multi -flowered, shield -shaped largest flowers (about 5 cm in diameter) in abolia abundant, usually small usually white or pink, sometimes lilac or red fragrant and three -year -old box there is no slowly growing summer, autumn flowering period and perennial should be well -drained in the summer. non -tolerating frost, so fairly cold -resistant plants prefer Solar places or a light shadow, let Abelia breed root, less often with seeds or cuttings and for the cottage and garden, Rod Abelia enters the Honeysuit family and has about 30 (according to other sources of 35) of slowly growing compact bushes, in the wild in east and southeast Asia, Mexico and South North America. In Russia, the plant is found in the south of the Primorsky Territory.\n\nDepending on the species and varietal features, the height Abelia can vary from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The dimensions of individual strong-wide representatives of the genus are able to reach 5-6 meters.\n\nRepresentatives of the Abelia family are beautifully flowering shrubs with a magnificent, well -branched and spreading crown. The diameter of the crown in most species varies from 1 to 2.5 m. The shrub branches are flexible, thin, directed upward (in tall bushes - directed down). The leaves are usually glossy, dark or light green, pointed or ovoid with small ZAZUBRINS along the edges. In the family there are both evergreen and deciduous forms. There are also representatives of variegate (variegated) forms. In addition to wild and cultivated species of Abelia, there are also hybrids bred by breeders. Below are the names of the most popular varieties of decorative Abelia, which are popular among gardeners and landscape designers. They plant a bush in well -lit or slightly shaded areas protected from the wind and drafts. The soil at the place of landing should be loose, fertile, well -drained.\n\nThe dimensions of the landing pit should slightly exceed the diameter of the root coma of the seedling. A layer of drainage (crushed stone, broken brick, expanded clay) is necessarily laid on the bottom of the pit. When planting a shrub on a area with heavy clay soil, large river sand is additionally introduced into the planting pit.\n\nThe plant is planted by transshipment, along with a lump of earth on the roots. The seedlings placed in the pit are carefully covered On all sides of loose garden land mixed with humus and peat. The rules for caring for Abelia, grown both in open ground and at home (winter gardens, indoor mini-orange), are practically no different. Below are the basic procedures that this plant needs. It is optimal for the propagation of Abelia that its basal shoots are suitable. To obtain a new generation of shrub, the shoots are dug up in early spring, capturing part of the mother’s root, and transplanted it to a permanent place. While young plants take root in a new place, they provide protection from the bright sun, wind and cold. You can create such protection using agriculture.\n\nA good result can give cuttings - a method in which Abelia is propagated by the semi -dedicated fragments of shoots. Planting material in this case is harvested at the end of summer - early autumn, when the plant bakes. Further, rooting cuttings are carried out in mini-punches with loose fertile soil. Landscaping designers usually use Abelia to decorate recreation areas on a personal plot. The flowering Abelia looks perfect as a hedge, framing not only recreation areas, but also the boundaries of the site.\n\nUsing Abelia as an element of hedges, the diameter of its crown in adulthood should be taken into account.|||Ledum heather (Ericaceae) Bagunik northern hemisphere grows in coniferous and mixed, often larch forests with high soil moisture, as well as along streams and on the hings, often forming a continuous, improper carpet carpet, bushes of the perennial growing in subarctic and moderate Garden belts, together with the gum, essential bagulnic oil can be used in skin processing, it can be used in soapworking and perfumes, as well as in textile Industry as a fixturer and evergreen popular no Bagulniki honey poison (the so-called “drunk” honey), it cannot be eaten without boiling, no leathery whole-shaped, often with a wrapped edge, the pubescent or glandular is located in the next way a sheet in the sun, and also acquires a brown-brown shade, and also acquires a brown-brown shade, The dark green sheet only has no bushes growing in a stable shadow, no no, white 5 5-10 thin shields 5 The cracked box winged and sharp, specific stupefying April-June, a sour, unrestrained is reproduced by seeds, cuttings, layers, division of bushes and root offspring in everyday life, is also called a bugrovnik, a baguon or forest rosemary. It is included in the heather order of the heather -flowers, forming a special family in them. His botanical relatives are cranberries, rhododendron, actinidia, camellia. And also in their number fall:\n\n\n\tnon -stroke;\n\tcage;\n\t2 type of verbanics;\n\tBlack or Eben tree. The creeping, or extended, the lobillar was settled by Siberia and the Far Eastern region. You can see it on Sakhalin and Chukotka. Such a plant was found in the northern regions of North America. It is found even in Greenland. The adaptation to harsh conditions forced the creeping lobillar to reduce its height to 20-30 cm.\n\nHe became the usual inhabitant of the shrubby tundra, sand hills and moss swamps. See the shoots of this plant with their Red-haired hairs can also be on rocky placers. Flowering falls at the end of spring and the very beginning of summer. Although individual flowers are large, the plant looks still scarce at that moment. The length of the sheet is from 1 to 2.5 cm. The bagulate is well taken into account in any place. However, it should not be planted in bright light, this culture is better adapted to the conditions of shadow cultivation. Strong and loose soil, as in a swamp, will be perfect. In the landing holes, 3 shares of top peat are placed, 1 The share of sand and 2 shares of coniferous earth (sometimes replaced by wood bark). Some types of luggling grow well even on poor sandy ground, in which case sand should dominate the mixture.\n\nIt is usually recommended to plant a bagulate in the spring. However, for seedlings with a closed root system, this is uncritical. Given the long-term development time in one place, the holes are digging from a depth of 40 to 60 cm. 5-8 cm of the drainage mixture created from sand and river pebbles are poured in their lower part. It is important to remember that Any part of the lugger contains toxic substances. After any work with him, one must not forget about thoroughly washing hands. Ideally, you should work in gloves. Earth for this plant should be constantly wet, it is also recommended to add needles into it. The just planted culture should be mulched by peat. The seminal method of breeding the lobed implies the collection of seeds in the fall. Sitting seeds extracted from the boxes is produced in the spring. The containers should be filled with loose earth, mixed with sand. Seeds are placed on it. Then the tanks must be covered with plastic wrap and placed in cool places. Further care will go the same as on another seedlings.\n\nBagolnik is mainly diluted by cuttings. The harvesting of cuttings should be carried out in the summer. It is useful to treat them with heteroauxin for more active production of roots. Before rooting, even small residual portions of the drug should be thoroughly washed off. Lightburn resistance Pathologies and dangerous insects are unprecedentedly great. Even stagnation of water near the roots, destructive to many other plants, is almost no danger to him. Subject to systematic loosening of the soil, the fungus cannot appear.|||Adónis aestivális, Gorisytyt Summer, corner in fire, Eye of Phazan, Lyutic Adonis Adonis Summer North Africa, Front, Central and Central Asia, China, Indian subcontinent, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, Carpathians, Dneprovsky District, Moldavia, Crimea, North Caucasus, Zavlezhier, Oberminomorskoye. and the Nizhne-Volzhsky districts, the south of Western Siberia, the Transcaucasia grows through the solonetzed meadows, shrub thickets, steppes, dry slopes, in the shadow of the rocks, like weeds in crops and in cattle parking lots In the mountains to a height of 2,000 m above sea level, herbaceous plant is medicinal, decorative; With cattle, geese and pigs are not eaten, it will phenomenon 10-50 shirts when thickened in the upper part, in sparse plantings from almost each sinus of the sheet to 4 orders of the branching, forming a spherical bush of the erect, erects twice or three times non-part-time-powered, linear-green fiery, red, less and less and red. Orange multifaceted. Numerous seeds with solid cover, Three-sided, with a hooked curved nose, are located spirally on an elongated hollow stalk at the end of May and in June, according to other sources from April to August under the winter or in April-May, a fertilizer, loamy, well-drained moderately moisture-free-sized plant, in hot weather during drying, during a permanent place. Soils of watering are necessary on poor soils, top dressing with complex fertilizers is required, especially after thinning and during the period budding; Fertilizer only during the period of active growth is a photophilous plant, however, in shaded places, growth and development do not stop, although flowering is a less plentiful cold -resistant plant, an unpretentious plant such a plant as summer adonis is still known under the name of the summer of summer. Culture belongs to the Lyutikov family, which means that its close botanical relatives turn out to be:\n\n\n\taconite;\n\tanemone;\n\tAquilegia;\n\tlarkspur;\n\tclematis. The angle of the angle in the fire gives in full Red petals, the middle of which is painted almost pure black, which fully justifies the varietal name. The grace becomes only greater due to the openwork of the foliage. Experts emphasize the importance of stratification of planting material. There are no difficulties with the cultivation of Adonis Summer from the seeds in the garden. This type does not make requirements for the soil, with the exception of looseness and excellent drainage. Lighting practically does not play a role. The plant can be grown close to various bushes and trees. However, we must remember about a great need for moisture. The irrigation is required to be engaged without waiting for the soil to dry.\n\nAdonis summer is propagated mainly by seeds. The soil temperature should be +5 degrees, and planting can be carried out in the autumn and spring months. In early autumn, the rhizome is divided. Yes, the germination will be slow, but the culture will suffer frosts well. After strengthening the seedlings, diving or thinning is required. Need to achieve So that there are at least 25 cm between the flowers. Defends must be planted where there were no buttercups before. Summer Adonis contains toxic substances. Harmful insects and fungal diseases almost always bypass this plant. There are no problems even when other flowers are completely infected. This property will delight those who cannot devote much time to concern for landings.|||Albuca asparagus albuka endemic southern Africa indoor, flat or with keel-like protrusions from 8 to 120 gray-green and have a characteristic shape, formed by three outer leaves, free and radially located flowers vary from white to yellow or greenish shade of 2 brush A box containing a lot of seeds flattened or angular, black bulbs and flowers of some species smell, especially at night growing on The full sun is well -drained some mountain species are quite frost -resistant to Albuka - a genus from the family of asparge. This flower is a close relative of Agave, Aloe, Eucharis, Khavortia, Yucca and many more cultures that the Family Family gave floral growers.\n\nPlants can have a height of 8 to 100 cm, depending on the species. The leaves are collected in a socket, they are juicy, but narrow, different shapes, flat or tubular, twisting in spirals at the ends, of different lengths, from 10 to 100 cm. Thanks to The plant looks very exotic curls. But spirals need a plant not for beauty. This culture is a succulent, that is, he knows how to store moisture. Due to the form, the leaves evaporate less water.\n\nThe flowers are small, up to 3 cm in diameter, but elegant, sit on peduncles up to 100, more often up to 60 cm. Flowering lasts up to 2 months. The flowers are single or collected in brushes. The number of petals is 6, the corolla resembles the bell, and the general view of the flower - the orchid. Shades of corolla - white, greenish, yellow, with stripes. There are more than 150 species in Albuk. Of these, several were widespread in indoor floriculture.\n\n\n\tBractoler (Albuca Braacteata). A plant with straight narrow leaves resembles a bow. The leaves are long-up to 1 m. The bulb is large, light green, up to 10 cm in length. Flowers are very beautiful. Collected in a plentiful brush on a peduncle up to 90 cm high. The number of flowers can reach 100 pcs. The flowers are white, with apple green stripes, very fragrant. Transplanted in the fall when the plant The rest period ends.\n\nThe soil for planting is loose, granular, breathing well. The thick layer of drainage at the bottom of the pot is required. Add to 1/3 of the sand to the ground. The pot is selected in the diameter of the bulb. It is optimal if the pot exceeds the diameter of the bulb by no more than 2 times. In standard home conditions, the plant belongs to unpretentious. But he has his own preferences.\n\n\n\tThe flower loves the abundance of the sun. You need to choose the brightest place in the room.\n\tOptimum air temperature in winter +13 ... 15 ° C, in the summer +25 ... 28 ° C.\n\tAbundant watering during active growth and flowering. Watering, imitating natural conditions - moisture should completely wet the earthen lump, but between irrigation it must dry completely. The roots of the plant are adapted to such a regime, but constant dampness will perceive poorly.\n\tBy the rest period, watering is smoothly reduced.\n\tThey feed regularly fertilizer for succulents. Only in the active period.\n\n\nWater it with warm and defended water. Watering in the pallet It is preferable that the onion is not wet. But if when watering from above, the soil dries well in 1-2 days, then you can water on top. The plant forms the onion bulbs. It is they who most often propagate a flower. Plants grown from children bloom the next year, in the spring - in May. The onions are immediately planted in small, up to 8 cm, individual pots.\n\nAlbuki seeds retain germination for no more than 6 months. Instructions for reproduction by seeds.\n\n\n\tSowing in the ground for succulents.\n\tCover film, hold crops at a temperature of +26 ... 28 ° C.\n\tMoisturize, ventilate, monitor the level of moisture. Moisture should not stagnate in any case.\n\tAfter 2 weeks, shoots appear. In excessively dense soil with poor drainage, the plant can suffer from root rot or fungal diseases. If there is a suspicion that the plant is damp and flooded, watering is immediately stopped, they give the substrate completely dry. Or the plant is removed, washed in potassium permanganate and dried well. In the future Place the bulb in ideal conditions: an abundance of light, maximum loose soil. You can plant a sick albuka in a mixture of sphagnum, sand and perlite.\n\nAnd also in the rooms, the flower can be affected by a spider mite. In this case, the plant is treated with a “phytovers” or other acaricide.|||Alpinia Ginger Alpinia Asia and Oceania Grassing Planted Perennoper growing in tropical and subtropical zones, indoor alpinia galanga is used in medicine, a well-developed plant, 25-40 stems no up to 200-300 no when rubbing or on the fracture, large lanceolate or oblong-ovarial and reminiscent of the type reminding me of type. shells with bright red or white bracts. Color-shaped box plant with long horizontal strongly led red-brown rhizome with a thickness of 1-2 cm and up to 1 m long, there is no turf soil, humus, sand (1: 1: 1) with a neutral reaction, abundant during active growth, from April to October, it is necessary to feed every two weeks, preferably fenced shoots are cut off, and the rest is left to continue to continue The heat -loving growth grows well in light rooms in the sun or in a light partial shade unpretentious at least 20 ° C; winter (c November-March), when the plant is resting, the temperature should be reduced to 15-17 ° C. Regular spraying large leaves collect a lot of dust, so they often need to be washed with warm water with rhizomes and seeds resistant to diseases and pests, the Alpine plant traditional for the countries of Asia refers to the Alpine family. This kind of herbaceous wild cultures needs appropriate growing conditions similar to the climate of subtropical and tropical zones. All includes in it About 240 species of plants.\n\nAll alpine is characterized by the following signs:\n\n\n\t\n\tThe root is long, strongly branching, up to 1 m;\n\t\n\t\n\tThe central escape is strong, reddish;\n\t\n\t\n\tFlexible stems, bearing leaves and flowers, from 60 to 300 cm long;\n\t\n\t\n\tfruits of the box with seeds inside;\n\t\n\t\n\tThe inflorescence of red, yellow or white shade;\n\t\n\t\n\tpurple and red berries. Special diversity is one of the main advantages of this plant. In the wild in Russia it does not occur, but successfully It is grown in potted culture, in greenhouses and just on windowsills. Here are the most common species. Alpinia feels quite comfortable when growing as a room flower. It is enough to provide it with good conditions, as well as properly plant.\n\n\n\t\n\tAfter flowering, seed material is collected in boxes.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe substrate is prepared. It should consist of turf, sand and humus in equal shares.\n\t\n\t\n\tSeeds are sown. The optimal term for this occurs in January, in 2-3 decades. The seeds are not strongly deepened, the soil surface is sprayed from the spray gun.\n\t\n\t\n\tGrying is carried out. During this period, the ambient temperature in the place where the pot is worth it should reach +22 degrees and above. Before the appearance of sprouts, film shelter is used.\n\t\n\t\n\tObtaining seedlings. Prior to the appearance of viable roots and shoots, sprouts are sprayed, ventilated periodically, but withstand in a greenhouse. To get stable flowering from the exotic plant in indoor conditions It is difficult, but quite real, if you properly organize care for it. Alpinia poorly tolerate severe dry air and poor soil, require maintenance of stable temperatures in the room. All subtleties of care should be considered in more detail. The main method of breeding the Alpine is to divide the root. When transplanting in early spring, fragments of the kidneys from the underground part are separated in the dug plants, the sections are powdered with crushed wood coal. Then the resulting root segments are transferred to Separate pots.\n\nAnother method of propagation is seed. But there are subtleties here. Seeds quickly lose their germination, they must be sowed immediately after collecting. Alpinia is not too susceptible to diseases. They are affected by fungi or infections only in case of violation of the conditions of content. When the color or structure of the leaves changes, the formation of spots on the plates and the stem, the plant is isolated, treated with fungicides. Among the potentially dangerous insects, a spider mite can be distinguished - it is easy Detect on the shoots left on the shoots with thin whites, as well as aphids. This sucking parasite deprives the plant of juices, but is easily destroyed even by a solution of laundry soap.|||Big, cancer cervix, snake root, Gorlets, Bistorta Officinalis is widespread in the tundra, the forest strip and in the steppe zone in regions with a moderate climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including in the European part of Russia and in Siberia, forms thickets on swampy and damp floodplain and water cutting meadows, along the shores, along the shores, along the shores. reservoirs, found in forest glades, in shrubberry thickets. snake species perennial one of the favorite plants of the northern deer, leaves and young The shoots are edible, use the coil in the liquor industry, as a medicinal raw material, like a honey plant and a decorative plant, a perennial grassy plant, a type of mountain of buckwheat medium-sized 30-150 six-symbols, relatively straight, low to 30 lengths, 1-7.5 width of a petiole, oblong or continuous-lanceolate, with slightly slightly wavy edge, pointed to the top from above green, from below the blue pink pink from May to June, the inflorescence of the apical, dense, Colos -shaped, small flowers (about 0.35 cm) three -sided smooth shiny brown nut 3-4.5 mm do not tolerate the shading, moist and rich in organic substances with a slightly acidic reaction; It takes close groundwater in the middle climatic zone winters well without additional shelters of 3 (from -40 ° to -34 °) This medicinal plant refers to the buckwheat family. The relatives of the highlander Zmein are such cultures as sowing buckwheat, rhubarb, sorrel. More even more Close relatives are representatives of the same botanical kind of coils. The family is quite large - about 50 species. All of them are rhizomes of perennial herbs for cool areas. Among them are few \"celebrities.\" The coil is large, he is also the most famous highlander. The coil is large, he is also the most famous highlander. Its Latin name is Bistorta Officinalis or Polygonum Bistorta. Bistorta in Latin means “twice twice” (bis - “twice”, Torta - \"Twisted\"). Of the varieties, the highlander \"Superbar\" (Persicaria Bistorta Superba) is most famous. It has a height of 40-60 cm, his inflorescences are light pink, larger than that of a wild mountain man. It grows well, forms dense curtains, blooms in June. The plant loves moisture and does not tolerate dry places, otherwise it is an ideal culture for gardens with minimal care. It will especially please those who do not know what to put on a wet, flooded or low -level area with closely located soil waters. The highlander is propagated by a snake division of the bush in spring or autumn. You can propagate with seeds, they germinate quickly. They are stratified in the refrigerator, then sown directly in the ground in the spring, when they pass fruit, or to seedlings a few weeks before planting in open ground. You can sow in the winter. The plant is very unpretentious, has excellent immunity. Diseases and pests are not subject to. In the arid periods, the aboveground units die and appear again when the conditions become more wet. The highlander is a snake - one of those few plants that suffer an excess of moisture. It is planted along the banks of ponds, natural and artificial. Borders, decorative groups are formed from it, planting one by one in suitable areas.\n\nIn mixed flower beds and mixborders, the highlander best copes with the role of a background plant. But since only a few crops suffer high humidity, such a highlander can rarely be seen in mixtures. Most often these are large monogroups.|||Ceropegia Woodi is found in the South African Republic, Swaziland and Zimbabwe Wood an evergreen succulent average growth rate, thin, shallow small, short-green with marble silver-white pattern on the upper side and purple from the bottom is a narrow, vertically growing, vertically growing. The pipe painted in a pale pink color emerging from a small rounded purple base is small pink August, September, October, November for several months abundant They prefer to grow in bright lighting the plant comfortably feels on the southern and partially southern windows +23-23s, in winter +12-16s undemanding is a special substrate for succulents with the addition of leaf soil or a universal substrate, in which you need to add at least a third of loosening additives and lower sand, the soil must be allowed to dry in the upper and partly medium-sized layer, and the water is in the water. - Do not allow to accumulate regular, but moderate top dressing from March to the end On September, as necessary, focusing on the growth, in February or March with cuttings, nodules often suffer from felt and aphidly in the care of ceroperia is a grassy plant, which, depending on the variety, can be different: erect or creeping. The shoots of this plant are quite fleshy, and the leaves have a lanceolate, heart -shaped, linear or ovoid shape. The plant has filamentary shoots. Ceropesgia has several folk names: Beach umbrella, snake liana, parachute, necklace, flower-background and others. It can be maintained using special woodcocks or other designs that wrap the stalks of the plant. Botany scientists distinguish several varieties of Wood Ceropesgia. The Glori Silver variety is distinguished by unusually attractive white leaves with a green bucket. Orange River is another unusual variety of this plant. A little -known, but interesting variety is Green Harts. In addition, other varieties of this flower are grown: “Simon”, “Durban”, “Ampliata” and others. At home, Wood Ceropel is grown quite successfully. In this case, the humidity can be completely any. However, ceropeling requires a large amount of sunlight. In the summer midday hours, you should take care of a small shading in order to avoid burns on the leaves. With insufficient lighting, the leaves become faded and small, their number is reduced, and flowering may stop. So that flowering does not stop, the plant It is worth moving closer to the light source.\n\nIf proper care is carried out behind the plant, then it can bloom almost all year round. However, the flowers cannot be called very decorative, so some flower growers simply remove unattractive flowers. Cropegy is grown primarily due to beautiful foliage. Wood Ceropel is propagated by several different ways: cuttings, seeds, tubers or dividing the rhizome.\n\nFor propagation using cuttings, it is necessary to perform their workpiece. It is carried out in early March, before the start of intensive plant growth. For this purpose, it is necessary to cut several stems of the plant and a few of them should be tired, and then planted for rooting in a container of several pieces. Next, pour them moderately and place in a cool place where the temperature should not exceed 20 degrees. In addition, the place where the pot with seedlings is located should be well lit. In this case, it is necessary to secure the cuttings from the hit of direct sunny rays, in order to avoid the appearance of burns.|||Pennisetum Alopecurides Zloki Pennisetum Pennisetum Lis-high-free species decorative look good and in group and solitary plantings, 100 erect narrow, linear juicy and green panes are perfectly adjacent to the conifers, golden-yellow panels 20 cm reddish-green. decorative, especially in autumn, the loamy sun with prolonged absence of natural precipitation is recommended moderate watering on poor soils. Feeding gives a good effect Complex mineral fertilizer from leaves or spruce branches of the early eternal bush recommends low pruning at an altitude of 10 cm from the soil level with drought -resistant, heat -resistant can winter in the middle lane in hot weather can be affected by rust in the end of the summer. Late -muddy pennisetum has another name - peristoconestic fox -cirrus. The botanical name of the culture in Latin is Pennisetum Alopecurides. The plant belongs to the group of perennial cereal crops. Total in The world has more than 150 species of pennisetum, but the fox -sting is considered the most popular and interesting. The birthplace of the described variety is Australia, according to other sources, Asia.\n\nPennisetum Lis -stroke is grown on garden areas for decorative purposes. The plant often varies in height: the smallest grow up to 30 centimeters, the largest - up to 150. The leaves are long, about half a meter, very narrow, with a sharp end. In spring and summer they can be green, as well as Purple, cast purple. In the fall, they become a sunny hue. To date, there are several varieties of peristoconial fox -wowie. Consider briefly the most interesting.\n\n\n\tRed Hed. This is a pretty attractive dwarf variety. Belongs to the group of hybrids, has the shape of the correct sphere. Low -growing, rarely grows above 30 centimeters. The spikelets of the cereal are reddish, with a slight shade of haze. The leaves are also picked gray.\n\tHameln. A round small bush with a diameter of 0.4 meters. Height - 0.5 meters. The leaves are saturated green, after cooling, they turn yellow. The spikelets are white-yellow, quite pleasant to the touch. In the fall, they acquire a red color.\n\tRubrum. This is one of the highest varieties of pennisetum, grows up to 150 centimeters. The spikelets grow in groups, slightly fall down. Painted in pink or reddish tone.\n\tMaudri. The height of this variety is 1 meter. Its interesting characteristic is spotted foliage. The panicles are dense, can be painted in light or pinkish collars. In the fall they darken, acquire a deep purple underon.\n\tViridesssens. A rather interesting variety with purple foliage. The inflorescences are very dark, almost black, beautifully cast purple. Culture is growing to 0.7 meters. Pennisetum is best grown first with seedlings. So the culture will receive strong immunity and will grow much faster. Sowing grains is customary in the April period, then in a month the finished sprouts can be moved to open ground.\n\nFor planting the material you will need Fertile loose earth. It can be made with your own hands from a garden substrate, peat and sandy components. The soil is mandatory to be calcined in the oven. The containers will require small ones, since the seedlings of the peristocracy of the fox do not tolerate diving. It will best grow in peat cups. The depth of grain immersion in the substrate is 2-3 mm.\n\nThe covering film from the containers is removed after the appearance of the first sprouts. Seedlings will need care. These are moderate Watering, recovery of bioswilies, proper temperature and ventilation. 14 days before planting, seedlings are slowly starting to accustom to street conditions. This process is called hardening. It is not difficult to care for Pennisetum Lisov. It is only important to pay attention to the following mandatory points. Pennisetum of the fox -core is propagated by seeds or division of the bush. We have already described the seed method of landing. It can only be added to this that the plant can multiply and on one's own. When the seed box bursts, the wind spreads the seeds along the site and beyond. When propagating with seeds for the first time, if you did not grow a culture before, they can simply be bought in a store. The main thing is to choose a good manufacturer.\n\nThe second method of propagation is the division of the bush. It is necessarily spent once every five years, since by this time the bushes are aging and begin to degenerate. To carry out the procedure correctly, the bush must first be baked with a shovel. It is necessary do it deep. It doesn’t matter if you cut the roots a little. Having rushed the plant, it is taken out of the soil with the roots. The ground from the roots is shaken off, then the bush is cut into 4-5 equal parts. The middle area of ​​the root is thrown away, this is already degenerated material. The remaining parts are buried to the places allotted for them, irrigated efficiently. As practice shows, the fox -wrapped pennisetum bushes winter. The upper part of the bushes is left for the whole winter. Before leaving for the rest of the plant also Water. Moisturing watering allows the bushes to endure the cold well, the roots are injured much less. A spruce or foliage is placed in the trunk circle. If it is not expected to snow, then the culture should be additionally covered with agriculture. If strong winds are coming, the bushes need to be tied. The described plant is very often used in landscape design of plots, gardens and parks. It does not make special requirements on the soil, easily tolerates heat and drought, and therefore is like that in demand.\n\nVery often, the peristoteine ​​is grown in large flowerpots. They can be put, for example, before entering the house, on the terrace, in the recreation area. If such bushes grow in open ground, then smaller crops will stand out in their background. In addition, large plants will become a spectacular accent of a zone that I would like to highlight. They can also form an interesting hedge. This is taken into account even when landing: in this case, it has to be made dense."

Apricots are decorative (differ in early and abundant flowering, beautiful autumn foliage) and are used in landscaping, fruits are used, Seeds, wood of apricot wood grow for a long time, in a warm climate up to 100 years there are no endangered species medium-sized 5-8 young shoots shiny, naked, reddish-brown, with numerous small lentils, longitudinally cracked gray-brown, egg-shaped, pulled, fine-toothed or fine-treat double-shaped large 6-9 cm long the next petals are rounded, elliptical or back-shaped 2.5-3 small petals white with pink veins or pink pleasant honey yes Singleous fruits in the outline are rounded, elliptical or backward, with a longitudinal groove yellowish -red (“apricot”) color of the cultivated varieties juicy or dry, in wild -growing - rough -fiber and cultivated varieties are sweet, in wild flavoring there is no rapidly growing spring in June - Augustus - Augustus - August The perennial of the soil requires light, well -drained general principles of pruning apricot trees the same as all fruiting To plant in well -lit (especially in the morning) sections of the garden, trees are resistant to drought. Most varieties of apricot apricots are frost -resistant, withstand frosts up to −25 ° C, and more persistent up to −30 ° C is high, average 4 (from -34 ° to -29 °), 5 (from -29 ° to -23 °), 6 (from -23 ° to -18 °), 7 (from -18 ° to -12 °), 8 (from -12 ° to -7 °), 9 (from -7 ° to -1 °), 10 (from -1 ° to +4 °), 11 (from +4 ° to +10 °) into cold, cloudy, low -white apricot trees suffer mainly from moniliosis, and Klysterosporiosis for The dachas and garden Apricot is common to the pink family. The homeland of this tree is located in the east. In Russia, apricot trees began to be grown only in the XVII century. Initially, the plant was also known as the \"yellow -handed\". An ordinary apricot is stable both to the heat and the cold. It is undemanding to the composition of the soil, because it has a powerful root system. Therefore, the tree grows well in any conditions.\n\nIn a height, the plant can grow up to 8 meters. But most of the deciduous trees are more low. The average height of apricots is 4-5 meters. Their trunks are covered with red-brown smooth bark. With age, she begins to darken and crack. The lush crown of the tree is decorated with rounded elongated leaves. Their surface is glossy. Many gardeners growing apricots in their area do not know, their fruits are fruits or berries. According to the botanical definition, they belong to bone fruits. This is justified by the fact that inside each fruit is a bone that is easy separated from the pulp.\n\nNevertheless, apricots, like plums or cherries, most gardeners are still called berries. This is due to their size and time of fruiting of trees. It is recommended to plant apricots in sunny areas. The soil in the selected territory should be light, with neutral acidity. It is recommended to plant apricot in open ground in the spring. In this case, he will have time to take root before the onset of cold weather.\n\nAt the same time, the place for planting a young seedling needs to start Cook in the fall. To do this, in the selected territory, you need to dig a hole with a size of 80x80 cm. In the center you need to place the pegs. He must protrude 70 centimeters above the ground. In order to prevent stagnation of water and rotting of the roots, the bottom of the pit is covered with a layer of broken brick or crushed stone.\n\nThen fertile soil is mixed with peat or humus in a ratio of 2: 1. Pure wood ash can be added to the same mixture. It is very simple to take care of an apricot of ordinary. Multiple apricots can be propagated the main ways.\n\n\n\t\n\tCuttings. Green shoots are cut off from young healthy trees. The branches are cut into small cuttings. Each of them should have 3-4 green sheets. Prepared cuttings are immediately planted in a container with a substrate. The plants are rooted throughout the summer. In the fall, they are transferred to the cellar, where they are stored before the onset of heat. In the spring, rooted cuttings can be planted in open ground. It is best to plant them immediately in a permanent place. Normal development and fruiting The apricot of the ordinary interfere with various diseases and pests. To protect their trees, many gardeners spray them with a solution of copper sulfate in the spring. But such a preventive measure does not always help.\n\nOften, apricots growing in the garden affect the following diseases.\n\n\n\t\n\tMoniliosis. As a result of the disease, the bark is covered with light gray growths. The foliage at the same time darkens and falls. If a fruiting tree is sick, you should not count on a good harvest. Most fruits will dry out or It will rot without having time to mature. You need to fight the disease radically. All damaged branches must be removed and burned. The trunk and crown must be treated with Bordeaux liquid. Fans of apricot trees will be interested in learning a few curious facts about these plants and their fruits.\n\n\n\t\n\tByzantine emperors believed that the use of fresh apricot juice allows you to extend human life.\n\t\n\t\n\tGardeners often cross apricots with other fruits. Usually for this purpose, plums of different varieties.\n\t\n\t\n\tWhen drying, the fruits of apricot almost do not lose their beneficial properties. Therefore, it is recommended to include kuraga in the diet of both adults and children.\n\t\n\t\n\tApricot seeds are used as raw materials for the preparation of marzipans. In their characteristics, they look like bitter almonds.\n\t\n\t\n\tThere is a black apricot in nature. This plant is a hybrid of an ordinary apricot and cherry plum.\n\t\n\t\n\tArmenians call this tree their national plant. In many other countries it is also It is known as the \"Armenian apple.\"\n\t\n\n\nThe fruits of apricot trees are considered dietary. But people with diabetes can not be consumed. Unpretentious, but beautiful apricot is often planted in personal plots. Usually it is located next to other fruit trees. Apricot also looks very good in single plantings. In the spring, he pleases gardeners with his flowering. In the summer it is decorated with juicy orange fruits, and in autumn - yellowing foliage."

In the north of America and in the European regions, Chinese ash is grown as a decorative representative of the flora.\n\nIn England, the Chumak adorns London parks and squares with its presence. To Ukraine and Russia They brought it to feed them a silkworm. Today in the south of Ukraine you can find large territories with the plantations of Ailant. He is a frequent representative of the flora of Crimea and the North Caucasus. Planting Chinese ash can be done both with seeds and seedlings. A tree, like a shrub, can breed in parts of the rhizome and seeds. The latter must be stored in a bag of fabric, while the room should be dry and cool. Often it is propagated by offspring and cuttings. However There are cases when the culture independently gives a young shoot from which the plots can overgrown. The Chinese niathus often suffers from rodents and small animals that bite its trunk in the winter. To prevent such an unpleasant situation, it is recommended to protect the plant with wrapping. The culture is immune to infections and fungal ailments, so it is quite rare."

It has been known since ancient Egypt, where the plant attached great importance to the plant, considering it a symbol of life and death. Other nations also revered acacia, according to legend, noev ark was even made from its wood. In addition, wood, bark and acacia leaves were vastly used in medicine, ritual and religious practices. Acacia belongs to the Bobov family - this is a rather high tree that can grow up to 25 meters. Thanks to the large species The variety of evergreen acacia can be formed by a tree in the usual sense and a large shrub. The roots of acacia are very well developed. Since the tree grows in one place for many years, the root system is increasingly deepening into the ground in order to get everything necessary for life. A strong branching of the roots is noted in the upper layer, in the deeper layers of the Earth they are located directly. The standard diameter of the culture trunk is a little more than a meter. The bark is different Smooth, can have different shades: brownish, gray, green. At a young age, these are usually light colors, in mature - darker, closer to the brown. On some varieties, sharp spikes may also be present. Acacia is found in a variety of places in our planet. Wild acacias prefer desert southern regions, in particular, these are Australian and African acacias. They grow in deserts, can be found even on rocky slopes. However, this area of ​​growth is not limited. Many varieties of acacia, both tree -like and bushes, grow on marshy soils, in lowlands, subtropical forests. They can often be found in Mexico, India, in Madagascar. Today, about 800 types of acacias are known, each of which has its own characteristics and characteristics. Of course, it is not possible to consider each of them, so we will give a brief description of the most popular specimens. Golden. Wood height - up to 12 meters, leaves in shape Oval, yellowish. The inflorescences are large, white, the smell is quite strong. Before planting acacia, it must be selected correctly. To do this, it is best to contact nurseries that will help you choose strong seedlings. Before buying, the entire planting material is inspected, it is important to ensure that the roots are not weak or frostbitten, rotten. The presence of an earthen coma is allowed. In addition, many nurseries sell acacia right in the pot. It is better to choose a month for landing for a small Highlights, following that there is no increased humidity in the soil. It is optimal if the site is protected from winds that can harm the inflorescences of young trees. Most types of acacias are very unpretentious, they do not require complicated care and grow quickly. To successfully grow home or garden acacia, it is important to remember only a few rules. Two methods are available for acacia propagation. Semenia. This method is more complex and expensive in time. For him you will need seeds which can be purchased both in a horticultural store, or to collect from beans at your own acacias. The landing begins at the end of March, until that time the seed is kept in the cold. Before planting, the seeds are poured with boiling water, and then half a day is kept in a cold liquid. After that, they are buried by 1 centimeter in fertile soil with a small amount of sand. Containers are covered with glass and placed in a bright place. After a week, the sprouts will grow, the glass is removed, providing the temperature air at least +20 degrees. Acacia is almost not subject to viral diseases, but fungal can appear. Most often, this happens due to the fault of the gardener, which too densely planted the trees, excessively watered or did not process sections after a spring haircut. Sometimes the fungus comes from other crops. Consider the most common diseases. One of the most unpleasant diseases is white rot. It progresses in the summer, in the heat and humidity, manifested by grayish and white growths on the trunk and branches. Seeing These growths, the affected parts of the tree must be cut and burned, and the acacia itself should be treated with fungicides, including the soil. When the foliage only blooms, acacia can attack the rust. Fluffy spots of brown color appear on the bottom of the foliage, if they ignore them, over time the foliage will turn yellow and die. As a prevention, it cannot be allowed that the fallen foliage remains on the site, in which the spores of the fungus winter. Treatment is the treatment of Bordeaux fluid. The dew basically develops by mid -summer. A whitish plaque occurs on the foliage and branches, red spots appear a little later. As in the previous case, all fallen leaves are first collected. Then the tree is treated with fungicides, for example, “ambulance”. Having decided to grow acacia on your site, you will never lose, because this tree is universal. It is used in the creation of alleys that look fresh and beautiful, and can also act as a tutor. Acacias of different types are planted with coniferous Trees, they look very unusual with stunted Christmas trees and thuja, juniper. But the most interesting feature of acacia is that you can form many interesting figures from it that will make the design of the garden unique. In addition, acacia, especially yellow ones, look elegant in company with bright colors of cool shades. For example, a successful idea will be planted nearby daffodils, forget -me -nots, irises and any other flowers of blue and purple colors. White acacias are recommended To combine with pink, light yellow, red cultures, then the composition will turn out to be very light and airy.|||Albizia, bean albias wood, shrub decorative decorative cultural, no 6-9 medium-sized flowers have very long stamens of sphering summer, perennial albia is loved by the owners of winter gardens, greenhouses, it is grown in open ground in those areas where winter is quite soft and warm. The culture grows perfectly at home, which allows you to cultivate it in colder regions, because openwork leaves and amazing flowers made the plant very Popular. In nature, albration looks like a tree with a thick and wide crown up to 7 meters in volume, or a powerful shrub with a height of 6 to 10 m. The tree -like varieties have a well -branched root system, but its surface arrangement sharply reduces winter hardiness. Albicia, or Constantinople acacia, is very popular in landscape design, since it has high decorative properties all year round, even in the winter period, devoid of foliage.\n\n\n\t\n\tAlbias Lenkoranskaya Pompadour (Albizia Julibrissin Pompadour). Fluffy inflorescences gave a reason to name the plant with silk acacia. The spreading crown of a powerful tree with a height of 7 to 10 meters is covered with matte openwork cirrus-green foliage. The back of the leaf plate is painted in lighter tones. There are varieties with foliage of purple or purple shades. The inflorescences are large (up to 12 cm in diameter), fragrant, with a thick beam of long stamens of light red, pink, cream palette. Lenkoranskaya blooms Acacia in June-July, in perfect climatic conditions-until September. In indoor conditions, it is grown as a bonsai or low tree. For the successful development of the plant in open ground, several agrotechnical conditions will be required. Albration needs a high level of illumination, with mandatory protection against northern winds and strong drafts. If there are no special requirements for the fertility of the Earth, then there are compositions - acacia does not tolerate sour and heavy clay soils. Structure The soil should be light, loose and breathable, with a neutral pH level. Clay lands are structured with the help of riding peat, river sand, perlite, vermiculite.\n\nSoil composition for independent preparation:\n\n\n\t\n\t1 part of the turf land;\n\t\n\t\n\t1 part of the leaf land;\n\t\n\t\n\t¼ part of the total volume of peat and sand.\n\t\n\n\nThe optimal time for transplanting seedlings to a permanent place is soil heating to a temperature of 15-18ºC. If sowing seeds is carried out, then sowing material It needs preliminary soaking for 24 hours in hot water. Seeds prepared and treated with stimulants are buried in the soil by 3-4 cm. For seedlings, holes are dioxide in size exceeding the volume of the root system. At the bottom, it is necessary to arrange a drainage layer of rocky material of a small fraction: gravel, pebbles, gravel. For indoor plants, ceramic pots are considered the most suitable. The pot should be small, since transplants and Transvading. The appearance of albration, growing in open ground, as at home, largely depends on subsequent care. The most important procedures for growing from seeds or seedlings are traditional agrotechnical measures. Albicia is propagated by a vegetative way (cuttings), sowing seeds and a basal shoot. The first method is most practical, but requires the necessary knowledge and experience. The second option will require much more time, suitable for inexperienced Gardeners or in the absence of another planting material. Sowing provides for mandatory stratification within 2 months. After that, the seeds are germinated in a constant place in a mixture of sand and peat or in agricultural. The first sprouts appear after 1.5-2 months.\n\nFor cutting cuttings, the apical parts of one -year -old shoots with noticeable lignification are chosen. The length of each cuttings is 10-15 cm, the lower cut is made at an angle of 45º, the upper edge should be at a right angle. Leaf plate shortened on ⅔. The lower slices before planting are powdered by the “rhizome” or soak in its solution. Landings increase the roots for 2-3 months. Planting with cuttings is covered with agrofloor or film, regularly watered and ventilated. Acacia is in good health, as it has excellent immunity. A healthy garden plant is practically not subject to pest attacks. Corpses growing in greenhouses or at home can be affected by a spider mite or Shields, especially if succulents grow in the neighborhood. In order to prevent plants, insecticides are treated. The reason for drying out in the spring of the annual increase in branches can lie in the fungal disease of Coral Spot. In the fight against it, fungicides are used.|||Arallia aralia aralia wood, shrub, grassy plant area of ​​the Rod covers tropical and subtropical regions, less often enters the moderate areas of moderate, subtropical, tropical Asia (southeastern Asia, island of the probe archipelago), central and North America, North America, decorative decorative wild-born no Original decorative plants, attractive not only by large leaves, but also with lush inflorescences, as well as a kind of appearance, The exotic view of the landscape in homeopathy uses the essence prepared from the fresh rhizomes of the aralia of the broth in all parts of the aralia contains various toxic glycosides, saponins and alkaloids and widespread shoots, leaves and inflorescences naked or pubescent tall, low plants of plants are different: herbs. reach 0.5 in height, while some trees can grow up to 20 branchy at the top usually a sewing trunk without stuck, Unproned-phraseological, often twice- or three times, often brought closer on short shoots and concentrated, in wooden views, near the top of the trunks very large naked or pubescent another cup with small teeth, tiles of large complex blizzards, rarely unsuitable brush, small berry berry berry berry, balloon five-, less often a hexagonal dark violet fleshy no no fast-growing summer abundant Aralia perennial in his native area Reach large sizes - more than 15 meters. But in our latitudes, its height is much more modest-an ordinary shrub from 1.5 to 7-8 meters. Interestingly, a strong branching of a shrub is noted at an altitude of 2 to 5 meters. With age, the plant trunk is covered with sharp and long spikes, which are located on the petioles of the leaves, which is why it is sometimes called a damn tree.\n\nThe roots of the bush are located at the surface of the earth. With a surface root system, the roots lie at a depth of 15 up to 25 centimeters. At the same time, the roots are very vulnerable and fragile. This fact should be taken into account when caring for culture. In natural conditions, aralia grows with a lush crown of the type of palm tree, without layers and processes. The trees are not branched. More than 30 varieties of this tree. Consider some of them.\n\nThe most noticeable representative in this family is Aralia Manchu or high, Far Eastern.

$ (IMG) .TR ('SRC', Defaultsrc);\n    }); The planting of seedlings can be planned in the spring when the leaf plates are in the kidneys, or in the fall, when the foliage is already opal. For this, a moistened area with moderate lighting is perfect.\n\nThe soil should be previously abused to the depths of the bayonet of the shovel at least a week before planting. The landing site should be well cleaned of garbage, weeds. After add peat and manure in proportions of 1: 1, dig it again, loosened.\n\nIN Diameter of the landing pit should reach up to 0.8 meters, and in a depth of 0.4 meters. It is immediately recommended to make fertilizers. The seedling is sent to the middle of the hole, gently falls asleep around the edges. After that, the soil around the tree is trim, watered. There are no difficulties when cultivating shrubs. It is necessary to follow agrotechnical recommendations, especially in the first year of life.\n\nAfter the seedling was already in the ground, it is better to mulch the trunk circle with a 2 centimeter thick peat. So young animals will take root better, the soil will not freeze in winter, and optimal humidity will remain in the ground. It should be remembered that mulch needs to be constantly updated. Propagation in natural conditions occurs with the help of seeds, shoots, offspring and cuttings. But at home, it is possible to propagate aralia with the help of seeds and root offspring.\n\nSeed material sprouts very slowly, but you need to water constantly. The shoots will appear three years later. It is interesting that the seeds remain underdeveloped, and in The moment of landing, they first ripen in the ground, and then begin to germinate. In addition, the shelf life of seeds does not exceed one and a half years. But if there is still a desire to propagate the culture with seeds, then sowing should take place from the beginning of August to the end of September. The recommended depth of sealing is 2 centimeters subject to sowing standards: one gram of seeds per square meter. Observe the distance between the holes of 50 centimeters. Muddle the landing with a thin layer of humus. Aralia is not subject to Fungk diseases only if it is correctly cultivated and watered.\n\nThe bearings, larvae of the May beetles, and wireworms pose greater danger. For this reason, it is recommended to carefully clean the site from all kinds of garbage and insects before planting. For example, it is not so easy to get rid of the wireworm if he started. All necessary measures must be carried out in the complex. It is necessary to put baits, use green fertilizers, constantly powder the soil ash.\n\nCope with With Khrushch larvae, you can also: we advise you to use insecticides, nitrogen fertilizers need to be used only according to the instructions, and it is also useful to plant white clover plantations next to the plant. Dung traps, coupled with chemicals, will help to get rid of the bear. Dangerous for the slug plant: it is best to collect them with hands or dig banks. Sometimes a salt or soap solution, chemicals are used. Aralia is a rather original and unpretentious plant. It is often Used in landscape design. Quick growth, decorative appearance - all this is an occasion to grow an exotic culture for decorative purposes. Its leaf plates are periystone in shape, reminiscent of a palm tree. The color scheme of foliage changes depending on the seasons: in the spring-green with a blue tint, in the summer-emerald color, and in the fall-pink-purple with an orange tint. Flowering fascinates: small buds of white and cream tones are collected in fragrant clusters.|||Fallopia Baldschuanica, “Mile per minute”, buckwheat Baljuan Baljuan perennial for household plots in the landscape style, framing the perimeter of the territory, sharing bright annuals, as a background of floristic compositions large liana of the medium-sized 1500 oval dark green green 205-50-50-50-50-50- 20-50 White from the very beginning of summer to late autumn blizzard, abundant flowering for wet sunny places without stagnation of water at the roots loves moisture with the onset of cold weather The above -ground part is cut off, young bushes are sprinkled with fallen foliage or peat 5 (from -29 ° to -23 °) diseases and pests of the highlander is not damaged by the culture of the Baljuan highlander, or the phallopia of the Baljuan, is well known for causing frequent disputes in neighbors, since it also spreads to their territory, it can quickly occupy any vertical surface, and can quickly occupy any vertical surface, and can be occupied. Thus causing various problems. This is a climbing plant that people either love or hate. Some love to care Behind Liana, others interfere with constant employment. It is also well known that it is difficult to get rid of it, since this liana is a relative of the Japanese blord, and it is very hardy.\n\nThe Highlander Baljuansky is a common decorative plant in private gardens. For the first time, the cultivation of this type on the territory of the private economy in 1942 in the sea dunes in Duinbergen (Knockka) was recorded. Currently, this type is naturalized in various places in coastal dunes, usually on wastelands near residential buildings. The Russian vine is a perennial deciduous plant with long woody stems, which, as you know, can achieve, under suitable conditions and 9 meters in length. The leaves are dark green, in the shape of the heart, and the flowers are creamy white. They almost completely cover the plant from mid -summer to autumn. Seeds (seeds) follow after the flowering period, they are dark and shiny. The Russian vine will grow absolutely everywhere on the poorest soils with a small level of fertility. It is best to grow on well -drained sandy loams with regular moisture, in the full sun or in partial shade. Helerates some drought. The Highlander Baljuan tolerants to a wide range of soil conditions. These plants are less prone to invasive spread on poor, meager soils. The described type needs a supporting structure. If the gardener wants to propagate it, it is better to use the cuttings taken in the fall and placed in a cold frame, unless the existing plant is not adult enough to Give seeds. Experienced gardeners grow the highlander Baljuansky from the seeds. They can be sowed in open ground, as soon as they ripen, in the fall or spring.\n\nThe Russian vine does not suffer from pests or diseases. To keep it under control, regular pruning is required throughout the entire growing season. The procedure is necessarily carried out in February, on a brainless day. It is extremely necessary for the plant to stimulate new growth. You can trim the phallopia every year from the end of winter to early Spring. To update the plant, the procedure is carried out at the end of winter, pruning is carried out 30-90 cm from the ground. This is a hardy curly garden appearance, which quickly develops a wooden stem, and it soon gets out of control. In old gardens, it naturalizes and quickly covers everything in its path, so it is ideal for quick landscaping of a bare wall or fence, for decorating an old tree that has lost its decorative look. As soon as the phallopia starts To dominate its owner, she forms huge cascades of foliage and flowers that hang in large stripes from the tree.\n\nIf the gardener uses this plant to decorate the gazebo, it will need a thorough annual pruning to keep the mountain under control. In the wild part of the garden, the phallopia can not be controlled. The Highlander Baljuansky provides a quick shelter from the sun, suitable for sieves, fences, arbors, pergola and walls. And you can also scatter its vines on the ground as groundcover plant to mask piles of stones or old stumps of trees. Sometimes this species is planted on the banks of ponds so that they do not crumble.|||Persicaria Polymorpha Variable species perennial as a hedge for decorating unsightly buildings, design for a pond or pool, on a lawn or a lawn, like a tinge on a lawn, in wood-shrub compositions a fast-growing large decorative perennial, high-speed, durable, branched, half-time, thick, solid large large Lancestate green white -cream, then pinkish, and in autumn brown white, pink in late June - until August, long small flowers, Inflorescences in the form of fluffy panicles, the smell of weak prefers places lit by the sun, but can also grow with partial shading moisture, drainage, nutritious division of roots in the spring, at the beginning of May winter without shelter, under the snow (from -34 ° to -29 °) such a plant as a variable mountain, has become a full part of the “new wave” and spreads into the new wave of flower XXI century. Success is associated with its extraordinary features. The size of the high -altitude mountain man is simply colossal, and it gives Creamy creamy inflorescences of a periyre type. The stems reach great thickness, visually resemble bamboo. But the look at the oval foliage completely disperses this assumption.\n\nThe flowering of the high -altitude mountains falls out for the summer. By the beginning of autumn, it is gradually reduced, the flowers become pinkish. In the intervals between vegetative seasons, this plant does not differ any aesthetics. When it blooms, there is a fragrance, but obviously not flower. This smell has both hot fans and constant opponents; One way or another, he is very weak.\n\nThe size of the changing highlander is 120x120 cm in the first year of life. Under normal conditions, an adult developed plant can grow up to 250 cm. Even botanists have not figured out yet what kind of genus it should be attributed to - there are as many as 3 candidates.\n\nThe upper part of the branches tends to branch strongly. The bush without additional processing is more like a vase. The leaves cover it completely, from the lower to the top. Inflorescences in the form of panicles are formed medium Flowers with a creamy-white tone. An important advantage of this species in comparison with other highlanders is its minimal aggressiveness, the lack of a tendency to capture new areas. This species does not have any varieties. Other varieties are distinguished by varietal diversity:\n\n\n\t\n\tsmall -headed; No matter how reliable the plant in itself, it should definitely be used correctly. Only subject to competent landing can it give a good result. The subsequent Cultivation. It is impossible to use seeds for this purpose. Cuttings or root offspring are used. The second option is preferred in the spring, until flowering has begun. Cuttings are used in the summer, when flowering has already ended, but the inflorescences have not yet faded. The layering will have to be carefully prepared and only then used as a separate plant.\n\nOffspring are already fully developed specimens, thanks to a highly developed root system and other features are fully adapted to development in the ground. The offspring must be isolated with a thoroughly sharpened knife. The soil should be prepared in advance, digging and feeding. In the first three days, such an instance needs to be shaded.\n\nWhen choosing cuttings, they prefer young strong material. Prepare it in the spring. Bringing with ribbons allows you to easily find selected among thick leaves.\n\nCarefully pressing the stem to the ground, it is spudded, and then watered the plot. After the formation of new sprouts, the stem Press the steel ring. Reducing power from the original bush accelerates isolation. 30 days before the expected transplantation, the stalk is cut off without digging out. Only after rooting, a transplant occurs. You can use the highlander in a classic English mixborder, where he manifests itself no worse than in a natural flower garden. Excellent compatibility with cereals is noted. Due to rapid growth, you can easily create a seasonal hedge.\n\nVariable highlander is well suited for design of border zones and coasts. It is often used in parks and garden plots. It can serve as an excellent back background for floral arrangements.\n\nWhite cirrus inflorescences make such a plant an excellent candidate for a mixborder. There it will form a vertical. When grouping several bushes, a green “screen” is laid, or poorly looking places are decorated. The highlander can also be used as a tapeworm. If all this is not enough, it is still used in the composition wood-shrub groups.|||PENDULA Japan whole -leaved in a non -shock form is used as a groundcover plant, as well as in groups, curtains, to decorate the coast of ponds and retaining walls, in a vaccinated form is used in compositions with coniferous and herbaceous plants, as well as in solitary plantings and sorting shrub or vaccinated stemwic The medium-sized maximum height depends on the stem, the creeping does not exceed 30-60 cm dense weeping thin, flexible, Long, naked, naked to the ground, short olive, olive-yellow-yielded or reddish various shades of rich red-brown-brown-colored whole, sitting without stickers Supply lanceolate young leaves are reddish or yellow-pink, very bright, then become dull green, sometimes with weak bluish plaque (from below-blue) without blue) Opinions 3-6 no uterine decorative, dense, weeping crown with hanging thin shoots of olive or reddish and female type Long yellow earrings appear in March-April until the leaves appear with the onset of spring, photophilous, transfers a slight shading the distance between plants-150 cm prefers rich, humble medium density or light sandy soils, grows well on peaty soils of moisture loving, makes some swampy, reacts poorly to overhaul and dry soil of soil In the spring, it is recommended that the full mineral fertilizer recommended regular pruning in the spring for removal of the dead, curved, frozen shoots and the formation of a beautiful, dense crown tolerates the drought well to tolerates a high air temperature with sufficient soil moisturizing the winter hardiness of the vaccinated shape in the Moscow Region is reduced, the root plants are characterized by high winter hardiness required, since at a young age it may be damaged by frosts and early nominal frosts of 4 (from -34 ° to -29 °) can be grown in a rooted form in the form of a stealing The Moscow region, most of Russia is stable of the goat of the IVO-a low leafy shrub or tree that can reach a height of 7-10 meters. The goat \"Pendula\" is an elegant decorative plant from the willow family, the height of which usually does not exceed 1.5 meters (the height of the plant depends on the size of the stem). When choosing a place for planting willow seedlings, you should take into account the magnitude of plants in adulthood. The care of goat willow provides for the implementation of a set of simple events. In order for the plant to fully develop and have an attractive appearance, it needs regular watering, periodic top dressing and spraying (in the dry season). The goat of willow is considered an unpretentious plant, resistant to damage by pests and pathogens of various diseases. Most often, problems with her health occur with improper or insufficient care.\n\nCrooked leaflet is one of the most dangerous pests that pose a threat to all representatives Ivov family. An adult is a large brown-gray butterfly, the larvae and caterpillars of which erect leaves, kidneys and young shoots of plants. In willow, affected by this pest, the leaves begin to twist and dry. To destroy the caterpillars and larvae of the leaflet, insecticides are used - “Karbofos”, “Lepidocide”, “Danitol”. Pendula willow is usually used to create group compositions. It looks excellent surrounded by perennial and annual colors, decorative Brushnikov - jasmine, mock -up, thuja, lilacs. In spacious household plots, it can be grown together with other representatives of the willow family, for example, with a tall dew or spectacular rosemary -leafy willow.|||John Nilor CupressoParis leylandii supressus macrocarpa x Camhasuraris nootkatensis 1888 Hybrid (cypress x Cypress) Group and solitary plantings, used as a high hedge and colonnate coniferous plants quite large medium -sized to the ground. 1000-1500 to 200 rapidly growing up to 100 cm growing conical (pyramidal) thick erect reddish-brown or gray-brown, smooth, later layered, decaying into thin The plate strips are thin, long, light brown, located fan-shaped directed upward, evergreen dark green, there is no lighter green almost does not turn pale and does not storm the surface, the roots are strong, plentifully branched open soil, the moderate sanitary is stable and 6 (from -23 ° to -18 °) If the fertile layer of the Earth is small, a balanced system for the development of the plant is disturbed by wind resistant medium rounded to 2 Cuphasis is a rather unusual plant, which is deservedly considered a hybrid. It turned out as a result of crossing such crops as cypress and cypress. Both plants belong to the same family. In England, a long -term tree can be found almost everywhere. In Russia and the CIS countries, today the merchants is quite rare.\n\nMost often, it is grown in areas with a warm, moderately humid climate. Lilanda Kupressi -Sistice - the most successful A breeding hybrid obtained from large -fruited cypress and Nutkan cypress. The tree grows quite quickly-in 7-9 years, its height reaches 8-10 m, and the width varies within 1.5-2 m. The leaves of culture in appearance resemble needles. They are tightly pressed to the branches and to each other. Shoots departing from the central main barrel, multiple and rather long. Branches grow quickly. Among the gardeners, almost all varieties of Lilanda merchants are appreciated. Love landscape Culture won designers thanks to its decorative appearance and unpretentiousness in care. Varieties of the merchants can be combined with each other, for example, pyramidalis (Pyramidalis). The trees are planted on one flower bed or in different corners. Most of the varieties of merchants are shade -tolerant, so they can be planted on almost any area. The only condition is the lack of groundwater. The root system when moisture is rested will rot quickly, and the tree will die. Develops Culture is good only on fertile and moist soil. You can grow a plant in almost any soil, with the exception of a carbonate. It will be good to develop merchants -cypress even with scarce watering.\n\nCulture is not distinguished by high frost resistance, so it is better not to grow it in the Urals. The tree can survive frosts, but the temperature of -35 ... 40 degrees will become destructive for her. Seedlings, especially young ones, must be covered for the winter. Supporting circles mulch, Covered with spruce branches or agrofloor. Before the onset of cold weather, the soil is spilled abundantly. The greatest danger to the decorative culture are insects-virtues, such as the tree and a spider mite. You can fight them only with synthetic chemicals. Small holes in the branches and trunk indicate pests to defeat the trunk. They arise during the attack of the worm larvae. If the culture suddenly stopped in growth, then you need to carefully examine the tree.\n\nGet rid of Larvae can not only with acaricides, but also manually. A thin metal knitting needle with a pointed end of the parasites is pulled out of the barrel and immediately destroyed. In the store you can purchase insecticides in the form of sticks. They are inserted directly into the “move” on the barrel."

But that is why it is necessary to study it very carefully. From a botanical point of view, this is the genus of Lian, which is part of the Actinidium family; It is curious that the most famous species in the family is kiwi. The Actinidium family includes 2 more of the genus of the genus, little -known to the general public; It is included in the order of the hek -flowers, and within the framework of its \"relatives\" actinidia can count:\n\n\n\t\n\tcam;\n\t\n\t\n\tnon -traffic;\n\t\n\t\n\tpersimmon;\n\t\n\t\n\tebony;\n\t\n\t\n\tlingonberries;\n\t\n\t\n\trhododendron;\n\t\n\t\n\theather;\n\t\n\t\n\tcranberries;\n\t\n\t\n\tprimrose;\n\t\n\t\n\tloosestrife. Kolomict actinidia is the most winter -hardy appearance in the family, and it is great for the Moscow Region. The height of the growth above sea level is up to 1.3-1.4 km. However, on the northern boundaries of the range, it does not exceed 0.5 km. In nature, this species is found V:\n\n\n\t\n\tcedaro-chirocolide;\n\t\n\t\n\tfir-chirocolide;\n\t\n\t\n\tbroad-leaved;\n\t\n\t\n\tfir forests. Time to plant actinidium plants comes with the onset of spring or autumn. The optimal age of ready -made seedlings from the nursery is from 2 to 4 years. It is critically important to choose the right site for landing. If you prevent mistakes, the plant will be able to develop in one place up to 30 years. Although Liana is ten -loving, normal development is ensured only with stable illumination. The irrigation of actinidia in open ground must be carried out very actively. This moment is especially important during the drought. The soil near the root neck should be continuously wet. To care for a bush is also to spray it in dry periods. The procedure is carried out in the morning and evening hours. You can tie actinidia in the dacha to pillars made of oak, pipe from concrete or metal. In the intervals at different levels, they stretch the galvanized wire. The initial level is exactly 50 cm. Cold regions use collapsible trellises. They are inserted into metal pipes buried in the soil.\n\nLiana can be placed on trellis shields. The plants are recommended to tie to the supports using a twine, which does not harm it as much as a rough wire. In the southern regions for tall bushes, trellises in the form of letters are used:\n\n\n\t\n\tG;\n\t\n\t\n\tP;\n\t\n\t\n\tT (they are more voluminous). In Siberia, it is extremely difficult to find good actinidium seedlings. The main centers of breeding this culture is too Removen, which reduces the availability of planting material. In the winter, the plant and trellis will have to be placed on the ground, because for them you need to leave enough space. In the first year of life, watering plantings should be more often than the general norm. In the Urals, they advise planting no earlier than the beginning of May in order to insure themselves from returning cold weather. Actinidia, like other dioecious plants, can propagate itself only if male and female varieties grow nearby. Special breeding is easiest Organize roots with layering. In the spring, they choose the moment when the movement of juices begins, and the flowers bloom abundantly. The leaves and fruits of this plant are often affected by fungal infections. Phillostictosis is visually expressed in the appearance on the leaves of sharply defined spots. They have the wrong shape. Fungal lesions are avoided by minimizing humidity. Treatment of foliage spotting involves spraying with Bordeaux liquid or suspensive colloidal gray. Actinidia is extremely Widely used in the garden. This culture is a good choice of both the background for other plants, and as an independent dominant filling of the territory. Mostly actinidia is used for use in vertical landscaping format. Trees and stairs, terraces, arbors and other fences are well wrapped in this species. The wall of it will reliably protect the territory from excess sun, wind and dust."

From the peel Oranges are obtained by zest, used for the preparation of infusions and jam. In Bologna and Florence, the oranges peel are used to prepare various kinds of liquors. From the orange zest, there is no orange oil up to 100-150 years of age, the widespread tall whole, solitary, complex consists of a five-a-distance, poorly detached perianth with thick shares, many stamens and a single free, or “upper”, form, flowers sit six, and white multi-tagged brushes, and white multi-naked ones, Multivorite, with a thick two-layer peel, yellow-orange fruit consists of many juice bags-spindle-shaped, filled with juice of hairs and there is no slowly growing spring for a long-standing for a summer residence and garden, it is suitable for indoor cultivation that it will be better to grow orange trees in the room that it is more convenient to care for. The most popular are the so-called varieties-carlines that have a height of up to 150 centimeters. A Here with medium-sized plants a height of 200-400 centimeters are already inconvenience. Typically, indoor oranges are divided into 2 large categories. Now let's talk about preparatory actions, which precedes the direct planting of seeds. In no case should this step be neglected due to the fact that good processed seeds will increase almost 100 percent. The preparation of the bones of the orange for planting is carried out as follows:\n\n\n\t\n\tFirst you need to choose the largest and heavy seeds that will have the correct shape, without any defects;\n\t\n\t\n\tThey should be pulled out of the pulp of the fetus, and then rinse with running water;\n\t\n\t\n\tLeave the seeds for 24 hours in soft water. Now let's talk about how to plant the seeds. After soaking, they need to be planted immediately, or pre -germinated, putting in a wet fabric. After that, they must be put in a small container closed by the film, and provide room temperature, checking from time to time Moisturization and condition of the bones.\n\nAfter their creamation, you can start sowing. Here you need to perform a number of actions.\n\n\n\t\n\tTo deepen the bones 20 millimeters into the ground, planting one in one at a glass. If preliminary germination was not done, then it can be 2 pieces, and then unnecessary shoots can be removed. The laying of seed material is carried out to the side or nose up.\n\t\n\t\n\tAfter adding the earth, it is carefully required to compact and moisturize.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe cups must be covered film, and put them to where it will be possible to maintain a temperature at a level of 24-26 degrees.\n\t\n\t\n\tEvery day, the film must be removed for a short time for ventilation, and, if necessary, moisturize the ground. As soon as our seedlings have grown up, it's time to start thinking about transplanting seedlings to a more spacious place so that they can already grow, really, good. The first transplant of an orange is carried out at a stage when the plant has already acquired a couple of full -fledged leaves. For This will require a pot, the diameter of which is 80-100 millimeters, where the same soil should be placed as when planting the seeds. The transplant is carried out according to the method of transshipment with the maximum possible preservation of the cat's coma and the addition of fresh soil. It should be noted that any plants require care, care and attention. And in order to grow orange at home in a beautiful tree with fruits, it is also necessary to create certain conditions for this. In principle, for all Citrus rules will be common.\n\n\n\t\n\tSuch plants love light, but at the same time, the direct effect of ultraviolet rays is contraindicated to them. To grow at home such a tree is large and beautiful with the windows that they go to the north will definitely not work. The pot should be set aside from the window to some distance and deployed it from time to time, because the crown will become more spilling, and will not be bought. During flowering and the formation of fruits, the role of sunlight increases even more. And in the summer The possibilities of orange are best taken out into fresh air.\n\t\n\t\n\tCitrus trees do not tolerate cold and drafts. For such a plant to die, a decrease in temperature to +5 degrees is enough. At the same time, strong heat does not affect it very well. For example, the temperature at the level of +25 degrees begins to have a negative effect on flowers, as well as fruiting, because the tree will pay attention only to growth. The best temperature for such plants is +15 ... 18 degrees.\n\t\n\t\n\tWeakened shoots need to be cut in time, and cut the crown from time to time, which will reduce the load on the plant.\n\t\n\t\n\tEarth should always be plentifully political. In the spring and summer, watering should be carried out once a day at night, and in winter and autumn - a couple of times a week. But the spraying of the plant should be daily. Lubrication should be done weekly, and in the spring it is imperative to apply fertilizers suitable for orange wood. Now Let's talk about the care of an orange tree so that it grows quickly and forms beautiful, and also so that it does not feel discomfort in anything. For this, the main components of care should be considered in more detail. If you pay enough attention to the tree, then it grows quite quickly and actively. But it is not always possible to bring the plant to flowering and ovaries, and the fruits that appear can be small and completely tasteless. Oranges under consideration may not have parental characteristics and, in fact, be wild. To find that your plant is just that is quite simple in the first year of life, if solid green spikes appear on the barrel.\n\nGrow sweet and large oranges to grow at home, as those that are sold in the store, you can 2 methods:\n\n\n\t\n\tmake a conventional vaccination of a tree, using a seedling as a propeller for a variety type cuttings, which was obtained from an orange that already giving fruits;\n\t\n\t\n\tTo instill it by fencing, planting the kidney of the plant under a layer of bark and wood. It should also be said a little about orange diseases and pests that can be dangerous for him. The most common pests for orange at home are:\n\n\n\t\n\tshield;\n\t\n\t\n\tspider mite;\n\t\n\t\n\twhiteflies;\n\t\n\t\n\taphid."

Today, its growing area is the new Caledonia and New Guinea. Some species can be seen on the territory of South America, the island of Norfolk and on the Black Sea coast. IN Wild environment, the tree grows to 60 meters, while indoor species barely reach a height of two meters. The plant has a pyramidal shape of the crown, due to the location of the branches relative to the trunk almost at right angles. The Araucaria genus is a representative of the Araukariy family and includes 19 species. Below is a brief overview of the most beautiful and popular of them, growing both in the wild and at home. Araukaria is different (lat. Araucaria Heterophylla), which is also called “spruce in a pot”, is considered one of the most common species grown in indoor conditions. In a wild environment, the tree often grows to 60 m, and the diameter of the lower part of the barrel reaches 100 cm. The adult plant does not look very elegant: the appearance greatly spoils the half -naked trunk. However, indoor specimens have the right pyramidal crown and look great in apartments, greenhouses and winter gardens. The cortex of the Araucaria has a dark brown color and tar a peeling structure. The four-sided needles are painted in a delicate light green color. They are quite soft to the touch, are slightly pointed at the tips and are located on the branches in a spiral. In addition, they are slightly bent upward, which gives the branches a fluffy look. Araucaria multiplies quite well at home. For this, cutting or seed method is used. Araukaria grows very slowly, and therefore does not need frequent transfers. Experts recommend a purchased plant Immediately transplant into a suitable container in which it will be constantly. Crossing is carried out by transshipment with maximum preservation of an earthen lump. The first full -fledged transplant can be made no earlier than the flower reaches the age of three. Further transplantation is carried out once every 3 years in April-May. Care for araucaria in room conditions is quite simple and consists in watering, pruning, adding additives and creating optimum temperature, humidity and Lightness. In general, Araucaria has good immunity and is very rare. Many ailments are often the result of improper care, and if you do not take measures to correct the situation, then the plant may die. Below are a number of the most common diseases, as well as the causes that lead to their occurrence. So, if the tree dries and leaves or needles fall from it, then the matter is most likely in too dry air. To correct the situation, it is recommended to often spray the plant or Put a humidifier in the room. In addition, in the autumn-winter period, the tree must be kept away from heating radiators and other heat sources."

Both trees with a height of more than 17 m and shrub forms are known. A black-brown bark is formed on the trunk. Its cracking is fully consistent with the norm. Shoots of the first The years of development are painted in a reddish tone, and if the plant has been developing for several years, then they have an olive-brown color with a gray tint. Leaves are distinguished by a simple whole structure. They are characterized by a rounded or egg -shaped configuration. The housing is on the finger. The location is characteristic. Small straps go linearly and fall very early.\n\nThe flowers of the crimson are always wrong, grouped in brushes or in bundles. They can appear even on the barrel (this A characteristic feature of the Caulifloria). The corolla has a moth. A cup in the form of a wide, moderately oblique thickened bell, having a short dull teeth. The fruits of the ceresis are belonging to the category of beans, differ in a flat shape, contain from 4 to 7 flat rounded seeds. The spectacle of growth and flowering of this shrub would be a worthy decoration of the paintings of surrealists. But in Russia, original plants take root poorly. Yes, the copies beaten by frost with proper care come to life, however They will no longer bloom. Recently, breeders have been working on such a problem. In the meantime, there is no particular speech about the practical application of these plants.\n\nSuch basic varieties are distinguished as:\n\n\n\tForest Pansy (with purple-border leaves);\n\tPink pom poms (giving chic pink flowers);\n\tRuby Falls (characterized by a weeping type of shoots and dark purple foliage);\n\t“Rising Sun” - named so for the characteristic impression of the flowers. If there are cuttings with well -developed root The complex, landing is possible in April or May (more accurately can be said only in actual weather). The optimal distance between the bushes is at least 0.15-0.2 m. Ceresis develops well on soils with both neutral and sour reaction. For him, however, the quality of drainage and saturation with useful components is critical. Lighting is ordinary for open areas (bright sunlight or soft partial shade). At the very beginning of development and rooting, the Earth should be plentiful. Important: Seedlings and young shoots can suffer greatly from excessive insolation. They are more correct to plant them at least at first in partial shade.\n\nRegardless of age, the ceresis is extremely sensitive to penetrating cold winds, especially with high humidity - it is important to remember when the place is chosen. Be sure to check groundwater. The distance to them should not be less than 2 m. The presence of lime in the soil is welcome. There are references to successfully grown on strongly acid and alkaline substrates Bagryannik, but only experimental gardeners and agronomists should experiment with such extremely. It was established that the shift of the hydrogen in the acidic side increases the saturation of the color of the foliage in the fall. Despite the decent drought tolerance of Ceresis, irrigation is welcome. Only with its good organization can one count on rapid growth and intensive flowering. Young trees and bushes spill often, abundantly so that the earth does not dry out. After the plant gets stronger, you can do it already less. But still, you should focus on actual weather and the state of culture. It is usually not required to specially feed a crimson.\n\nIt is very good if the fertile land was originally chosen. In spring and during the summer, small doses of phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium are used. Other recommendations:\n\n\n\treplace individual fertilizers with Kemiro-Universal;\n\tto form a crown in the autumn period;\n\tremove the branches with dry or going inside;\n\tcarry out trimming in the first 3-5 years, then only eliminate frozen or too old shoots;\n\tavoid close planting of other plants;\n\ttransplant the culture in the second year and later only in the most acute necessity;\n\tMulch the trunk area for the winter;\n\tWrap the early shoots with the approach of cold weather. For this purpose, you can use both seeds and cuttings. The seed mass is stratified from the beginning to the end of winter. The procedure goes like this:\n\n\n\t1 day in boiling water in a thermos;\n\tDrying of swollen seeds on a towel;\n\t30 days in closed tightly bag on the lower tier of the refrigerator;\n\trepetition of the entire cycle from the beginning (in total, including the first call, 4 times);\n\tWith the advent of heat (stable 15 degrees or more) - landing.\n\n\nSeeds can be sowed right in the spring. But only after natural stratification will a shoot appear during the year. Sev is sometimes carried out in a box for seedlings. The substrate includes equal shares of turf, washed sand and leafy land. Cuttings are harvested in the fall (no more than 0.2 m, with 2 or 3 internodes). Shoots burrow In the pot. There should be wet sand of a large fraction. Watering - as it dries from above. The temperature during rooting is from 20 to 25 degrees, covering with polyethylene is welcome. Planting in the spring goes into holes up to 0.12 m deep, with a fresh oblique cut at 45 degrees; The hole is watered and mulched. Resistance to pathologies and “eaters” is a hallmark of a crimson. But in many areas, the plant is likely to freeze. Shelter and mulch will help prevent misfortune. In dry weather for culture The aphids are dangerous, which is scared away by preventive whitewashing. There are many convincing examples of high aesthetic characteristics of the crimson.\n\n\n\tThis is how his Japanese variety looks against the background of a brick wall and a metal -based roof."

At the same time, key issues come down to how quickly the banana grows and how many times it can bloom and bear fruit. It is important to start with the fact that the birthplace of this unique plant is Africa and Southeast Asia. Their life span reaches the 40 years, and the most Rich yields are removed in the first 5 years from young specimens. In our country, bananas are grown mainly for decorative purposes, since the fruits do not ripen due to climatic conditions. In this case, the implementation of the relevant agricultural techniques provides for:\n\n\n\ta process of wood (root offspring) or seeds;\n\tnutrient (fertilized) soil mixtures;\n\tcapacity of rather large size;\n\tcomplex top dressing. All representatives of the flora to one degree or another are demanding to the conditions of maintenance and the implementation of the rules of agricultural technology. Naturally, the described plants are not an exception, and they must be properly careful. If we are talking about a pet in a pot, then first of all at home you need to create an appropriate microclimate. Another important point is the constant monitoring of how quickly the banana develops, develops and blooms. Decorative bananas are considered to be long -lived. However, this does not exclude the need for a periodic transplantation of the plant. It is caused by record rapid growth, early and abundant flowering and similar fruiting. It is important to remember that instead of an obsolete individual, many healthy and strong processes often appear, which must be transferred in a timely manner into separate pots. The considered plant, as well as the vast majority of representatives of modern flora, propagated by vegetatively or seeds. At the moment, three ways to breed bananas can be distinguished, namely:\n\n\n\tseeds (some varieties);\n\tdivision of the root system;\n\toffspring. One of the important points when cultivating these plants in apartments is to eliminate mold in the early stages of seeds and offspring. If the first signs appeared under the glass, it is necessary to immediately process the soil with potassium permanganate and wash the shelter itself well. Such measures are used before the shoots will break down and the offspring is rooted. By the way, young sprouts during the first year due to record growth rates They will turn into strong plants with a trunk diameter that can reach 15 cm."

Sowing seeds, dividing the bush and summer cuttings and for the summer house and garden, the distinctive feature of barberry are fruits. They are represented In the form of berries, which in some cases are suitable. In addition, one cannot fail to note the high decorativeness of these thorny bushes, so they are a real find for landscape designers. They are especially popular with dwarf varieties that have small size and moderate growth rate.\n\nBarberry is not required any special care. It is drought -resistant and is frost resistant. Propagation also does not cause difficulties. About 600 species are combined in this genus All kinds of plants. Most of them are grown for decorative purposes. There are both huge and dwarf specimens.\n\nSpecies, in turn, are divided into varieties. They can be edible and inedible, grown for aesthetic or pharmacological purposes. Consider the most popular among the inhabitants of our country. As for this procedure, the seedlings are required to plant in the spring, after completely thawing the soil and before the first kidneys begin to open. If necessary You can plant barberry in the fall, at the time of the mass leaf fall. The plant on the stem is grown quite rarely.\n\nAs mentioned above, Barberry is not demanding in care. A partial shade or an open area located in the sun will suit him. The shrub is not afraid of drafts and strong winds. Sitting it in a shadow is not recommended for the reason that bright leaves with a red and purple tint look very impressive exactly when they are well lit. Barberis will not care To cause difficulties either in experienced gardeners, or even beginners. Almost all types and varieties are not distinguished by care, while there are no differences in agricultural technology. For example, you need to water and fertilize the decorative shrub of Tunberg in the same way as any tree with berries that can be used for food. Therefore, we consider the basic recommendations that are useful to everyone who is going to grow barberry. Barberry can be propagated in any way. We are talking about seeds Clovy, division of the bush and layering. Each gardener can choose an option to their liking. Let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each method.\n\nFirst of all, we will touch the propagation of cuttings. In this case, constant care of planting material will be required. In order to get cuttings, shoots of about 20 centimeters in length are cut off from the onset of summer from the bush. The foliage is removed in the lower part, and a phytohormon is applied to the slice itself. The upper leaves must be cut off.\n\nFor the cuttings A container with a soil mixture consisting of peat, sand and humus is being prepared. The third part of the trunk must be left above the ground, the rest should be burying. Plantings are watered and covered with polyethylene, but they will need to be ventilated every day. The term of stay in the greenhouse is about 2 years, after which the cuttings can be planted in open ground. Due to diseases and attacks of pests, barberry often weakens, drops the leaves and fades. If we talk about insects, they are especially unpleasant Barberry aphids or sawdrop, as well as a flower gender. The aphid is perfectly affected by soapy solution. You can get rid of other pests by spraying the plant with a solution of chlorophos.\n\nBarbaris is quite rare, but sometimes even a fungus affects it. You can successfully fight it.\n\nThe powdery mildew is expressed in the appearance of white plaque on herbs, fruits and stems, which is formed again even after wiping. I must say that the fungus is able to perfectly transfer the winter, so You need to start fighting him as soon as possible. Gardeners recommend treating a bush with a solution of 1% colloidy sulfur. I must say that barberry in the landscape looks very profitable. It can be planted in the country or in a suburban area. The color of foliage and trunks can have various combinations. The crown looks spectacular, the plant can grow even on city flower beds in suitable compositions.\n\nThe decorative properties of this plant are represented at any time of the year. Even in winter, bright fruits similar to Ledes will look profitable on a white snow blanket. The prickly shrub goes well with coniferous trees, standing out against their background. Due to the presence of a huge colorful, barberry looks great as a single landing, and in a group - it can take a central place. Hedges can be both from plants of the same variety and from various."

There is also its other name-“room maple”, which is given to him because of the characteristic type foliage. Abutylons fibers in India are traditionally used to obtain ropes, and sometimes bags. Therefore, sometimes Abutilon is also called a khank. The leaves of this plant are quite large (in length up to 0.1 m), have 3, 4 or 5 blades. Abutilon can form flowers: red; yellow; white. The attention of many gardeners deservedly attracted the hybrid variety “Juliet”.

You can not buy planting material in unverified places. When indoor maple has just been brought from the store, it is put into light for 2-3 days, and then transplanted to the Kashpo. The landing tank should be slightly larger than the transport pot. Abutilon at home requires active watering when the heat occurs. In the spring, radical pruning is necessarily performed on the crown. It is recommended to put the plant in light partial shade. But if necessary, the “maple” will be able to hold out for several hours in the open sun. In the summer months, culture is often kept on the street. However, in this case, it is placed where strong winds do not blow and rain does not pour. In the winter months, the canerbone will have to be highlighted. According to experienced flower growers, it is better to use fluorescent lamps. Propagate and It is quite simple to root Abutilon. To do this, use a vegetative method or seeds. Cuttings are cut from the top 0.1-0.15 m long. The buds will have to be cut off. Basically, rooting is performed in water. Occasionally, when breeding with cuttings, planting material is immediately planted in the soil. When preparing the soil, it is necessary to mix equal volumes of peat and sand. Additionally used activated carbon. A portion of coal is previously moistened. Some farmers mix the growth stimulator for water. The soft foliage of abutylons makes them a desired target for spider mites and thwounts. If infection occurs, you will have to use a solution of tobacco. Additionally, the leaves are washed with warm soap foam. To wash it off, warm water will come in handy. Such an old remedy such as the infusion of horse sorrel helps well. The same infusion helps to prevent the attack of pests. Healthy abutylons are sprayed every 14 days.

Some types of agaves are diluted in the tropical areas of both hemispheres to obtain a fiber. Many parts of Agawa are edible: leaves, flowers, core and juice are consumed.

Despite the external resemblance, Agawa has a number of unique properties. Water is collected in plant tissues, which allows even difficult conditions to successfully endure. The corresponding special fabrics are located in thick fleshy leaves. Basically, they are attached to a dense stalk. The main habitat of Agawa in natural conditions is South America, Mexico and the Southwestern US states. This is not a specific species, but a whole kind, numbering dozens of individual species. The flesh of agaves is significantly sweeter than sugar. On many plants, the foliage is covered with thorns and forms a socket. The peduncles are quite long. In the descriptions, they note the large length of the peduncles, as well as the fact that agava blooms only once in its entirety life. It is possible to grow this plant on the southern coast of Crimea and in other places of the Black Sea coast. However, there it is noticeably smaller than in his homeland. Basically, agava is used as an indoor plant. But in Mexico and other countries of the Western hemisphere, other features are actively used. The answer to this question is negative, which is very important for fans of floriculture. The approach to Agave should not be the same as when growing cacti. According to modern ideas, it belongs to Family of asparagus from the order of asparagus -stained plants. Additionally, the subfamily of agavovs is distinguished, which also includes: burghery; Beshorneria; Kamassia; Herreria; Hesperloe; Host; Yucca. The most popular among the varieties of Agawa in our country is American. Its bushes have a stem up to 0.3 m long. A basal socket is formed from the leaves. The height of the American agave reaches 1-2 m. Since the diameter can be 3 m, the plant can only be grown in spacious rooms. Agawa, as is already clear, not It requires particularly complicated care. But still, the basic rules for growing this culture should be taken into account. It should be remembered that it will never be as large as in the wild, at home. Since the plant refers to succulents, it must be put on the lightest areas. The sunny window is suitable very well. On the south side of the house - even better. But when severe heat occurs, it is necessary to carefully avoid moisturizing the leaves. Otherwise, burns may appear. IN Fectumes, as well as on the northern windows, agave can gradually lose vitality, but this problem does not immediately detect. For the propagation of room agaves, seeds are sometimes used sometimes, but such a method is difficult to consider optimal - the development rate is too small. In the last days of winter, it is necessary to put seeds in wet sand, burrowing them by about 0.01 m. They immediately cover the container with a transparent film or glass. Inside, the temperature of 20 to 25 degrees should withstand. 5-7 days after planting. Further on the 15-20 day the second leaf should be released, on 35-40 days-the third; By the end of the second week after this, Agawa grows to 0.08 m in height. Its diameter is 0.15 m. The outlet is formed at the time of the appearance of the fourth sheet. The easiest way is to grow a whitish, royal or threaded type of agave. In addition to ordinary procedures, such as watering, maintaining lighting and top dressing, it will be necessary to systematically clean the leaves. They gain dust capable of in an advanced state to violate photosynthesis. When growing agava, it is watered at a maximum of 10 days in 10 days. At the same time, they make sure that the surface of the earth is dry, but not overdried. When the growing season ends, watering becomes even less often - enough and 1 time in a month. The tropical succulent is little susceptible to diseases, but you must always remember that errors when caring for it can harm the plant. The shield and trippace are especially dangerous from pests, due to which the plant Drinks and fades.

The most common varieties can be selected among African, umbrella, eastern or bell -shaped. Representatives of the genus differ in the growth of peduncles, the shape and color of the bells and leaf plates. Dialness in the definition of varieties is precisely the presence of many hybrids.

For a normal process of life, the plant needs regular watering, slightly acidic or neutral soil, warm air and sunlight. African lily can be propagated in two ways. From seeds. Seedlings are sown in March in the ground mixed with sand. Seeds are sprinkled with soil, sprayed and covered with glass. It is necessary to ensure that the soil does not dry out, maintain its humidity. Seedlings require daily ventilation - it is recommended to clean the glass for half an hour a day. When the sprouts will turn off and get stronger a bit, it is time to plant them into individual pots. This manipulation Combine with a transplant of agapartus in the spring. It is advisable to separate the average in size, since it is likely that the small ones will not bloom or will not take root. Planting is carried out in prepared moisturized soil. Eviling flowers in open ground. Literal of plants to a soft climate indicates the immunity of their cold. The temperature dropped below +10 s signals the need to take measures to cover the flower. For this purpose, a box sprinkled on top of sand is suitable sawdust. In regions where winter demonstrates a harsh character, a plant of the agamantium family is dug up before the onset of frosts, determined in the box and take away winter into the house. With the advent of spring, the flower is returned back. Gardeners in the suburbs also practice the wintering of Agartus in the room with cool temperature, since the winter in the local climate takes place at a minus mark on the thermometer. The plant is afraid of waterlogging of the soil, in connection with which rotting of the roots may develop. This is a flower signals yellowing of the leaves.

        "summary": "Long -flowered, Ageratum Astro (ASTERACEAE) Ageratum is mainly found in East India, North and Central America, a bush, a herbaceous plant of a perennial, an annual a resident of the tropics, but in more severe climatic zones there are no kinds of Ageratum, there are toxic ones, as they contain pyrrolylizidine Alkaloids bushes of sprawling 10-60 compact numerous, pubescent strong erect no abundant rhomboid or triangular The rough and medium-opposite, cherries, the upper-the next, almost seated no, no sky-blue, saturated blue, purple, delicate pink, white or carmine small narrow-pipe and baskets that form complex shield-shaped inflorescences of small 1-1.5 cm in diameter extremely small; Pyathedral seeds with a fan -shaped crest and fragrant from June to the first frosts, but there is no blooms very abundantly fruit in early September, in early April, sandy or loamy, A well -loosened non -core minimum is a couple of times a couple of times in the season with complex fertilizers, but in no case do not use the fresh mullein time removal of faded, dry inflorescences positively affects the well -being and splendor of the plant prefers a lot of heat prefers a lot of light for a drought -resistant Ageratum - a flowering grassy plant. It belongs to the Astrov family. In the wild, the flower can be seen in India, Central America. Garden varieties are cultivated in different countries, including in Russia. The description of the culture says that it is many years old. However, in the conditions of central Russia, the flower is grown as an annual. The fact is that the plant cannot survive the winter. No shelter is unable to protect the flower planted on the site from frost. Perennial specimens are found only in some greenhouses, where a certain temperature is maintained all year round. First of all, it is worth highlighting Ageratum Mexican. Sometimes it is called Ageratum Hoston or Gauston named the opener. This type of culture is most common. Such flowers grow up to 25 cm. The group includes many varieties that can have a white, blue, purple, pink tint. To get a beautiful flower of Ageratum, first sowing, and only then the grown seedlings are moved to an open area. Sowing is carried out from mid -March to the first of April.\n\nIn prepared containers Pour fertile soil. A mixture of sand, peat and humus is perfect. All components are taken in the same shares. Before the procedure, the soil is sprayed from a spray gun. Then the seeds are distributed on the surface. They are sprinkled with a thin (about 3 mm) with a layer of soil on top.\n\nAfter that, the box is covered with polyethylene. You can use glass. The container is left in a room with a temperature of about 22 degrees. A couple of weeks before the transplanting of young colors to the site begin to harden them. During the day they are taken to Street, gradually increasing the ventilation time. Of course, seedlings are protected from the rain and sunlight. The site in the garden is better to choose well -lit. In partial shade, the culture will feel good, but flowering in this case will be less magnificent and long. Water culture in moderation. The upper layer of the soil should have time to dry between water procedures. Seed collection is carried out directly after the end of flowering the bush. Seeds need to be assembled and put in paper plastic bag. Seed material should be stored in a dry and cool place. Culture is successfully grown not only in the garden, but also in the premises. To grow an Ageratum in a pot, you just need to choose a spacious container and prepare a good drainage. As a soil, you can use a mixture from a specialized store.\n\nIt is better to put the pot in the warmest part of the house. Make sure the flower will be well lit. In the summer, it will be possible to take the plant to the loggia or veranda. If you follow the simple The rules of care, from the beginning of summer days to the New Year, you can enjoy the magnificent flowering of culture.\n\nWater the plant under the root. Moisture should not fall on the leaves. The best time for irrigation is morning. After moisturizing, it is advisable to gently cheer the soil. This will increase oxygen access to the root system of culture. Fertilizers are recommended to be applied every 5-6 months. Indoor flowers do not get sick very often, but specimens growing in the garden are more vulnerable to infections and pests. Ageratum is a universal decorative culture. It looks excellent both in flower beds, and in combination with other flowering crops, and surrounded by low greenery.|||Aglaomorpha multi-leaf (Polypodiaceae) tracheophytes basket fern grows in tropical Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania in moist tropical media, usually in tropical forests the perennial of the tropics is perfectly fitting into the tropics.

Culture is basket fern. The tracheophytes belongs to many years and the family, which includes several types of aglaomorphs, each of which has its own unique features. Representatives of the family are found in tropical Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as in the zones of Australia and Oceania. The plant grows in wet tropical forests. Culture has large lanceolate, blade or cirrus-stick leaves that form a funnel-shaped structure. The leaves have a glossy surface and dark green color. A characteristic feature of the leaves are nectarians on the bottom of the records, where small sporangia for the formation of a dispute are located. Aglagomorph is not a flowering plant, and its flowers are absent. Aesthetic qualities and decorativeness make culture a popular plant for use in landscape Design and landscaping of the premises. The plant fits perfectly into the green walls and becomes an excellent element of landscaping of office premises. Its exotic appearance gives a special charm to the interior. It is a heat -loving plant and prefers bright diffused light. It is important to place a fern on the windows of eastern and western orientation, providing protection against the scorching sun with a light curtain. It also grows well in rooms with high humidity. When landing, it is important to choose porous, light, light moisture and breathable soil. And also a good drainage should be provided to avoid stagnation of moisture in the ground. The plant is uncertain, does not require complicated care. Regular moderate watering throughout the year and moderate top dressing with universal complex fertilizers will provide it with optimal conditions for growth. The fern is easy to propagate with a vegetative way. To do this, just break off a piece of rhizome, and it will start a new plant. It may be amazed martyr with a worm and shield. If pests are detected, measures should be taken to destroy them. Fern are one of the oldest plants on Earth, and Aglaomorph is no exception - it is of interest to the Flora botanists and connoisseurs.|||Gorisvet, Agrostemma cloves growing in Europe, Asia, America are found in crops of winter and spring grain crops. In many countries, there is a grassy plant of a moderate garden in floriculture as a beautiful decorative plant as a beautiful decorative plant as an arrogant plant. It is grown in high flower beds, in mixborders, massifs, sometimes for cutting. The agrostemma looks beautiful in a mixture with cereals and meadow herbs, a doll is part of the Moorish lawn It is not known to botanists as a cultivated plant, but as a harmful weed. Ordinary doll (Agrostemma Githago), which has sleeping pills and global properties, is used as a medicinal plant in folk medicine. Fresh leaves of this plant are externally used for hemorrhoids, boils, as a wound healing agent. The doll at one time was cultivated to process his seeds into alcohol and flowers stand in the cut for a long time, without fading up to seven days the greatest danger, this plant represents The fact that its seeds are poisonous, so the flour obtained from grain, clogged with puppet seeds, is also poisonous and 30-100 simple or branched, round in the cross-section of the erect plants fused at the base is the length of up to 13 linear or narrow-and-balance, at the top of pointed marmotes and are located on long straight-colored pedicels, usually dressed up, less likely same-sex, pestic pink, purple-red or white about 5 5 with solid or seized at the top of the bend, without a borrower 10 Multiply-seeded boxes, opening with 4-5 cloves almost black, 2.5-3.5 mm in diameter, more or less densely covered with spicy spikes or tubercles, convex plants with long (up to 80 cm), branchy main root of the Agrostemma Githago rhizome-an annual grass flower of a white or pink shade, refers The family is cloves, the family is puppet. The Slavs are called the agricultural board, perhaps because in a half -rotted form the flower looks like a monastic headdress (Puppet), which, incidentally, also contains Latin roots and translates as a “hood”. It turns out that a small field flower has two sonorous names at once.\n\nThe agricultural engine is only masked under a delicate harmless flower, in fact it is a poisonous plant. In the past, it brought a lot of troubles to peasant farms. If a doll was started in the wheat field, it was called the \"damn thing.\" Animals were poisoned with a flower that fell into hay, and the seeds accidentally ground into flour along with wheat grains, threatened people's health. Today there is no such danger, all impurities mechanically are eliminated from the grains of cultural cereals.\n\nThe agricultural system has the most poisonous seeds (contain an ashostemmine glycoside), the main thing is not to take grass in the mouth. Slavic girls have beautiful flowers into wreaths, the length of the stems allowed to do this. Good field bouquets are obtained from the doll. It is better to wash your hands after contact with the plant so as not to take food by accident during it during a meal. Such imprudence will lead to food disorder. Europe is considered the birthplace of a puppet of ordinary, but the plant grows in wild form and in many other parts of the globe - in Central Asia, in Siberia, in the Far East, in North Africa and even in America. Seeds were accidentally brought by cereal merchants around the world. In places suitable for climate, the agricultural engine is quickly spread. Not garden varieties are considered field weed grass, which prefers to grow in fields among cereal crops. The refined grassy bushes of the agricultural system fixes their erect stems upward by 30-100 cm. The stems are well branched and leafy with elegant narrow and long (up to 13 cm) leaf plates. They are fused at the base, their location on the stem is characterized as a opposite sitting. On each long peduncle, it is revealed through a bright bud. Most often, the flowers are bisexual, but there are pestle, same -sex. Garden species, like wild, contain five -petalled flower cups, their diameter (5 cm) surpasses the size of field beauties.\n\nThe flowers are snow -white or colored, with reddish tonality. Pink, raspberry, purple varieties differ in light, almost white middle. A clear vertical housing is visible on the petals. Flower heads in full opening tie the petals outward. The buds begin to open from mid -June and delight with their beauty until September. From the flowering doll there is a wonderful aroma that attracts bees from the entire district. The agricultural engine in open ground in spacious sunny areas is growing. This annual can also be grown in pots and containers, for example, to decorate the terrace, steps or platform in front of the facade. The puppet does not like shadow, thin stems begin to stretch even more, and the flowers are smaller. For high varieties, even in the light, a support may be required.\n\nBut cold, drought, the wind tolerates the plant without a single complaint. Summer residents even specifically plant a doll in windy areas to admire the beauty of trembling, as if soaring inflorescences. The agricultural system does not tolerate an excess of moisture, so it should not be chosen by lowlands, and the soil is suitable for well -drained, lime, fertile. To extend the flowering of the agricultural system, it is better to sow it twice, with a difference of one month. The plant is tenacious, so you can not bother with seedlings, but immediately sow to the flowerbed. A light drainage area is cleaned of garbage, stones and weeds, dug up, loosened, leveled. Scattered seeds Cover with a thin layer of soil and watered. When the doll on the flowerbed rises and grows up, forming 4 or 5 leaves, the crops are thinned out. To do this, leave one of the most strong sprout on an area of ​​20 cm2. A bushy herbaceous plant will develop from the sprouts, and although the bushes look airy, they still interfere with each other if they are planted too close.\n\nFor the normal development of the agricultural system, the plant grown up to 15 cm is pinched. Next, the following measures are carried out on care.\n\n\n\tWatering is carried out in a hot season, in the morning or evening. Under normal weather conditions, it is not necessary to irrigate, excess moisture only harms plants.\n\tIt should not be fed by the agricultural system either, otherwise it will increase greens and will bloom. They fertilize the crops once - before planting, and only if the soil is depleted.\n\tTall or overgrown bushes, flying from the wind, need to be tied to supports.\n\tDuring the ripening of the seeds, it is necessary to tear the seed boxes in time, otherwise the next An uncontrolled sowing of Kukol will occur for a year.|||Adenóphora bell bells of Eurasia, most species grow in East Asia, a grassy plant perennial plants are found in cold and moderate areas, the garden roots of Lilielitate Bubenchik are used in eastern medicine in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, there are no straight or mutter -shaped nasopodnoye, not a corolla divided into five blades, bell-shaped, tubular-lobed or funnel-shaped straight web and highly ciliated elongated Cystematic or panicked box, which opens in the lower part with three sashes or pores of ovoid, flattened thickened roots, there is no adenophore - this is a popular plant related to the bell -shaped family and the generosity of a bell. The name of culture is from the Greek language, literally translated as a \"iron man\". The reason for this name is the presence of warty glands on the ovaries.\n\nLong -bearing perennial, grassy, ​​with a very developed and powerful root system of the rod type. In total, about 60 subspecies in the genus, their distribution areas can be completely different. Some bells are endemics of certain territories. Adenophore was able to settle in many territories of the planet. Most species are common in East Asia. About 17 species of plant grow on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, almost all of them are concentrated in Siberia and the Far East. As well as adenophore, it grows everywhere in Europe.\n\nMeet this gentle The plant can be in the meadows, in the steppe, as well as in the forests of a coniferous or deciduous type, where it covers clearing opened to the sun. The height of the bell usually does not exceed 150 centimeters. The plant is characterized by straight and thin stems that are branched in the upper part. The foliage can be either another or mutter. In the lower part of the bush, the plate in shape resembles the heart. The samples located on the stem have an oval, lanceolate configuration. The edges depending on the species are Tot or smooth.\n\nAdenophore blooms in the summer. Flowers in shape are similar to bells or funnels, like a mortgage. They can be assembled in booty or blizzard inflorescences. The color of the flowers is represented mainly in the cool range. So, most often they are blue, bluish or lilac. But there are snow -white varieties. They look especially sophisticated. Like standard bells, adenophore flowers are characterized by the presence of a long pestle.\n\nThe culture blooms abundantly and violently, all The process lasts about a month and a half. At the same time, there are so many colors on the bush that they almost completely hide foliage. After flowering, the fruits and crooks are formed tightly filled with seeds. They open at the bottom. When planting a tambourine on the site, it should be noted that the plant is not suitable for every style direction. For example, in the classic garden or in the fact that it is decorated in the modern style, it will not look. But where there are landscape and rustic styles, Culture will definitely find its place. It is best to have it next to field vegetation: daisies, wormwood, yarrow.\n\nAdenophore looks especially beautiful on alpine slides. Her natural calm shades are in harmony with greens, as well as with the color of stones. Adenophore is primarily a wild culture, so in the conditions of the site it will not require much from the gardener. Nevertheless, it is very important to choose the right place, since the plant does not tolerate transplants. From them It can even die.\n\nIt is recommended to plant a bell in illuminated areas. But this is only if very abundant flowering is required. The culture as a whole is shade -tolerant, can be used for landscaping secluded shady corners. There she will be weaker, but there is no question of death. The selection of the gardener will be able to make at his discretion.\n\nThe type of soil does not play a special role. It can be loams, sandyards, clay lands. The most important thing is that they are neutral in terms of acidity and not Too moist. Adenophore hardly tolerates flooding, responds to this with a rapid rot of the roots. Watering this culture will depend on the surrounding conditions. You should focus on the weather and dry soil. Water the flower only when the upper layer of earth has dried. In a cool summer there are enough 3 waterings per week, in the heat it is done every evening. During precipitation, watering a bell should not be watered.\n\nIt is not necessary to fertilize the adenophore, but it will react to top dressing with more magnificent flowering. A good option is minerals that are introduced after snow mating and before the start of budding. But it is better to avoid organics, since in this culture it provokes fungal ailments.\n\nFrom time to time, you need to loosen the soil under shrubs, weed weeds. If possible, put Mulch under plants. She will protect them from overheating. Blawly dry leaves are better to remove from the bushes so that they do not pull on food. You can remove the leaf with your hands or through clean scissors.|||Adonis, cheknatik, buttercupic hairy (ranunculaceae) Adonis Eurasia in the forest -steppe and forest zones, grassy plant perennial, one -year -old moderate areas of garden looks good in rocky gardens and group plantings, and against the background of coniferous plants it really “caught up” with bright yellow flowers are valuable medicinal plants Popular no phenomenon, no up to 40 stalks simple or branched can be rejected or erect no densely seated by leaves of Adonis As if they consist of thin threads and stick out in different directions, from which it seems shagged multiple or palpable-dissected on narrow shares, there are no yellow or red large to 8-20 rhizomes short, with thick roots of brown-black, the flowers of adonis appear during the snow gathering in a protected place, a rich one prefers neutral or nested or netral The slightly alkaline feels better in sunny places with hot dry weather, watering is necessary enough drought tolerant In the first winter, young plants are covered in the first winter with a spruce gun with leaves or peat; Adults winter without shelter no does not require division or transplant, it grows in one place for more than one year propagated by seeds or dividing the adonis bush (adonis) is differently called a mochnatik or hairy, as well as a hare of grass. It is worth noting right away that from the spring perennials this is perhaps the most capricious, but those who decide to cultivate rarely regret such a choice. Plants are compact, up to 30 cm in height. They have thin shoots with thick viosity and bright single flowers.\n\nAdonis bloom in the spring, immediately after strong colds they seek to seem to the sun. Most of the species bloom in the second half of April. Flowering is not very long, but in most cases these are the first flowers in the garden, long -awaited, delicate.\n\nThese plants are actively used in landscape design. They can become a spectacular decor, decorate shrub groups or play the role of single soloists. Adonis looks great In a group with boxwoods, with thuja and tits, with magic. It is also considered a universal partner for cut garden plants. Adonis can decorate alpine slides and rocky gardens. The spring adonis is growing in the forest -steppe and steppe areas, in the Crimea. It can be found among mountain shrubs, in the editorial of the spruce, in the meadows in the forest, on the edges, open slopes. The flower is not very high, rarely reaches 45-50 cm, more often 30-40 cm. It is beautiful, has a simple or branched stem. On it - shaggy Palty-dissected sedentary leaves. The basal sheet plates resemble scales, divided into shares, the width of which is about 6 cm. The color is brown.\n\nFlowers appearing in April are quite large - up to 8 cm in diameter. They appear at the same time with leaves, this is a feature of the plant. Adonis is fruitful of spring at different times, it depends on the region of growth. In the southern regions, fruits will appear in early summer, in the northern ones - in July. The place of flowers is occupied by wrinkled nuts with hook -shaped Nosmiks.\n\nWhat is this plant remembered is probably a special device of leaves (among other things). They seem shaggy because they consist of thin threads that stick out in different directions. And the flowers, by the way, can be not only yellow, but also red, only such are less common. The rhizome in the mountain is short, the roots are brown-black, thick. The plant is more often called perennial, but can be adonis and annual. Of the perennials, Volga, Amur, Fluffy, Siberian, Siberian, Turkestan, gold and spring. The latter began to artificially breed in the 16th century, immediately both as a decorative and as a therapeutic plant. Flowers after planting will appear only for 4-6 years.\n\nThe Mongolian Adonis is more likely to grow on unclaimed pastures. A very rare plant introduced in the Red Book is golden adonis. Fluffy species grows more often on the edges of birch groves or in a flat steppe. His stems are densely pubescent, they are single. First, lemon flowers appear, then oval or Triangular leaves.\n\nSiberian, pleased with a high look of Adonis. It grows to 60 cm, its flower is very beautiful, saturated-golden. But it does not bloom in April, but later, at the junction of spring and summer. The Amur Adonis grows in the Far East, first it has large yellowish-golden flowers, and then leaves with petioles. This is a forest look, it also blooms for about 3 weeks. This is not the culture that adapt to strong shading. Adonis is very sun -loving, they can bloom Only with a long light bottom. But also the midday sun, obsessive rays to them are also “not to their liking”, and this is one of the signs of the moodiness of the mountain. Therefore, in the garden you will have to organize a special location - it will be more convenient to place high partners next to it. To light fitness to the plant to adapt easier.\n\nThese flowers are also demanding on the composition of the soil. Not only does the soil should be fertile, the culture also requires a large amount of organics, while the structure of the soil mixing should be light and loose. You can grow adonis from seeds, or you can - from seedlings. As for the seeds, if these are annuals, they plant them in November, to a depth of 1-2 cm. The germination of the seeds is not very long, because they usually sow freshly global. Shop seeds are sown in the greenhouse in the spring. Perennials are planted in the container in the fall, and then left in a cold place. In winter, if there is snow, they are sent to a snowdrift.\n\nThe soil for sowing is prepared as follows: mixing ground, sand and manure in a ratio of 1: 2: 1. The first seedlings can be expected when the air warms up to +20 degrees. But not always everything turns out like this - it happens that the seeds for germination need a whole year. Springs are given bright light, but only multiple - from direct sunlight must be protected. Seedlings are irrigated, the soil is carefully loosened every day. After it, it will be necessary to led, leaving a distance of 15 cm.\n\nThe transplant in open ground looks like this:\n\n\n\tThe best place for a flower is with an abundance of morning sunlight and afternoon shadow;\n\tSeedlings are planted with an interval of 25-30 cm;\n\tThe hole should be such that the root in it is located freely, does not cure, the spine should not be bent;\n\tAfter planting, the seedlings are watered and covered, flowering in the first year should not be expected - Adonis develops slowly. Growing Adonis is a troublesome thing, and he really needs a special, rare garden perennial is the same besides the same. Especially you have to tinker with watering. The plant needs to be organized Such conditions, in order to exclude waterlogging, but also so that there is definitely no drying out. Additional irrigation here is required. But if there are enough rains, you can refuse them - it always depends on specific conditions.\n\nImportant! Watering Adonis during drought is required to maintain light soil moisture and not let the plants die. They are sensitive to overheating.\n\nWhat else is included in the complex of measures to care for Adonis.\n\n\n\tTop dressing. Two per year is no doubt. During active growth In the spring, comprehensive mineral compositions are added to the ground stage. And immediately after flowering, the plant must be supported by phosphorus-potassium fertilizers. But it will even be useful for these two mandatory complex top dressing one organic. It can be just mulch or organic soil made into the soil.\n\tCutting. Here you need to be very careful with this event. If the plant dries partially, and it is already unattractive, the dying green fragments are still better to mask. Independent pruning can harm Adonis. The plant lays the kidneys of renewal for the next year, and 2-4 years in advance, and these points of growth cannot be damaged. Therefore, even pruning of dry shoots should be as delicate as possible - you need to leave hemp, cut the plant under the root. The kidneys on Adonis can not be touched at any agricultural techniques. This is real, one of the ways is the division of bushes. But this option is possible only for specimens that are already 4-5 years old. Procedure Conducted at the end of summer, you can - and in the first days of autumn. Bushes are divided into 2-3 parts. Each part should be powerful and large. The earthen lump around the roots should remain untouched. After planting, the gorizets are necessarily shade, watered very delicately. You need to wait for plant adaptation.\n\nDo not be scared that Adonis Delens will develop slowly. This is normal for this culture and a specific procedure. Perennials bloom at best for the next year (it depends on species).\n\nThe propagation of adonis seeds is a troublesome procedure, but you can try. The seeds of these plants have very modest indicators of germination, you need to sow only freshly -shaped material. Seals, even if they take root well, will grow very slowly. Previously, flowering is not expected for the fifth year. There is no point in stratification of Adonis seeds, because the germination of planting material will be almost completely lost, because it will have to be stored in the refrigerator for a long time, and seeds Plants are not adapted for this. Adonis is a poisonous culture, because pests do not particularly attack it. Rodents and insects bypass Goriztvet, and often also neighboring plants. But nevertheless, you can also call Adonis completely invulnerable. Under incorrect growing conditions, it is subject to rot: if it is poured or not organized by the flow of water, rot is very likely. Fusariosis can also get sick, it is provoked by a fungus. With this disease, it should be disinfected Plantings \"Benomil\".\n\nDespite the confident “image” of a capricious flower, Adonis is still popular with summer residents. There are among them those who say that the exactingness of the Goris is exaggerated, and in them it grows and blooms in perfect mode. Most likely, the conditions on the site are optimal and the gardeners did not lose their landing site. Well, the fact that the flower is beautiful, early and manages to delight with flowering immediately after the snow gathering makes it a winning acquisition.|||ASARINA, asarina Phytnian Azarina grows up in France and Spain and brought to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Hungary Poluskustarnik Perenoprika Perenopre's steel alpine or ground cover, no evergreen popular, no 10-20 somewhat overgrown stems give a loose creeper / cascading stems of the soem-covering stems.

(Liana), which scientists are attributed to the Physician family. There are about 15 varieties of this flower. Is a perennial plant, but in the domestic territory It is grown as an annual.\n\nIt is believed that this plant is from South America or California (USA). The plant gained its popularity around the 18th century, and since then it has been grown everywhere. Since the homeland of plants are remote countries, only part of the varieties was able to take root in domestic weather conditions. Here is a brief description of some of them. Despite the fact that the reproduction of the flower requires some effort, caring for it when growing in open ground is not Too heavy.\n\nDue to the features of the domestic climate, Azarin does not tolerate the winter (the plant is thermophilic), therefore it is grown as an annual. In order to prolong her life, it is necessary to dig her and put her in a pot that will be stored at home every fall. In the spring, the plant will need to be transferred again to open ground. In addition to the fact that Azarin gives Samosev, it can be propagated by seeds and independently. Preparatory work begins in winter. In order to grow out of the seeds A full -fledged flower, you must first plant the seeds in pots or a container with a substrate at home. As a substrate, a mixture is used, consisting of equal shares of humus, peat, sand and leafy earth. Immediately before the sowing itself, the seeds must be disinfected. The easiest way is to warm up in the microwave at maximum temperature. 10 minutes will be enough for the process. After you need to pour the seed with a hot solution of potassium permanganate. Seeds can be planted a day after these two procedures.\n\nThe soil is sprinkled with seeds, which will later need to be pressed to the surface of the earth. A layer of sand is poured on top (no more than 5 mm thick). After the entire surface is moistened with water from the spray gun. The surface of the container is covered with a film that is removed for a couple of hours a day. Seedlings appear about a month later. So that the plant does not spend strength, you need to cut out the wilted flowers or its other dead parts (dried leaves, for example).\n\nAs for most moisture -loving plants, fungi are a great danger to the gum. The flower can hit a black leg. This is a fungal disease in which the neck of the root begins to darken, then softens, as a result, the entire aboveground part of the plant is broken off. As a rule, the disease affects several plants at once, and the survival of plants is quite low. However, not yet affected plants located next to the sick, you need to transplant and water solution of the drug \"Fitosporin\".\n\nAnd also often affects Azarin and Aphid. Small transparent green bugs suck juices from the plant, as a result of which the leaves gradually become transparent, and then leaky. If aphids are detected, it is necessary to process the plant every week until the elimination of insects is completely eliminated. The drugs “Karbofos”, “Akarin”, “Fufanon” and others distinguished themselves with a good result in this regard.|||Azolla Salvini Azollah America is common in standing and running reservoirs of a subtropical and tropical indoor stern is used as an aquarium plant as an aquarium plant, which is a good shelter for fry and shrimp, as well as a reliable oxygen supplier for other inhabitants of the aquarium. Small ferns resemble a more duckweed or some moss leaves-Cheshuyka. Each sheet consists of two segments: The upper green, photosynthetic, and lower, immersed, absorbed tiny 0.05-0.1 are located on the upper side of the rhizomes 2 rows from bright green to burgundy and there are no rhizomes, floating, up to 25 cm long. Quite long subordinate roots are freely hanging from the nodes, serving as a shelter for a small water fauna, the rhizome does not bloom in the azoll - this is a water culture belonging to the Salvinium family of the same name and the family. The genus has about 7 different types. Many of They are growing so fast that they literally fill natural reservoirs, which is why they can be considered an environmental disaster.\n\nAcolla is somewhat similar to moss, duckweed or tiny fern. If you increase its twigs several times, then many will have an association with spruce paws or juniper branches. Growing up, culture covers the water surface like lace. It looks all very interesting, so Azollah has become so popular among aquarists and owners of garden Ponds. Azolla is widespread in the USA, there this plant is held in high esteem. However, in other countries, it is not so small. For example, you can see culture in the UK and Ireland, in Morocco, Hawaii, New Zealand, Japan and China, as well as in Australia and Africa. Acollah is a small fern that floats freely on the water surface. The leaves are tiny, their dimensions do not exceed 0.1 cm. The upper part of the leaf-Cheshuka is responsible for photosynthesis, the lower is immersed in the water. At This is the lower segment absorbs both oxygen and nitrogen at the same time. In winter, leaf records are in the “hibernation”, and in the early spring they awaken, quickly growing. The leaves are doubled in the upper segment of the rhizome. Their color can vary from emerald to burgundy.\n\nThe rhizome of the described culture is branched, floating. The length of the root is 2-3 centimeters, but there is also a look that grows up to 25 cm, it is only one. Culture is non -flowering. Among the owners of reservoirs, the following types of Azolls are especially common.\n\n\n\tKarolinskaya. The culture has an oval cut foliage of a green-blue shade. In this case, the lower part of the plate is pinkish. The foliage as the Azoll grows rapidly changes its color, becoming red. True, this happens only if the culture absorbs ultraviolet radiation. The most important condition for the Acollah is the presence of good lighting. In summer and spring it is recommended to put The capacity with culture under the scattered sunlight so that the plants receive natural light. A mini-paporot must be lit at least 12 hours per day. In winter, at home, lamps with white light are involved. For each DM3 should be 2-2.5 watts. Plants in street ponds are sent for wintering (stored at wet moss at a temperature of +12 degrees). This plant does not require any care. He does not need top dressing, watering, of course, too. It is enough to observe the conditions described Above, to achieve an active growth of culture. Azollah is not subjected to diseases, fish and other aquatic inhabitants do not eat it.\n\nSometimes vegetation can sink to the bottom, and this begins to disturb the aquarist. There can be two reasons in this case: a drop in temperature up to +16 degrees or natural aging of the plant.|||Grab, eródium Geranium Aistnik majority in the moderate belt of the Old World, two or three in South Africa and Australia and two or three are widely widespread throughout the globe growing in the steppe and deserted zone, managed to penetrate and take root in the distant north, a half-year-old plant, a single-year-old area of ​​distribution is occupied and the subtropical zones of the globe of the ball are magnificent in alpine slides and serve as a unique addition in complex Flower compositions are used in folk medicine inward and externally, but more by superstition than in fact, the popular no 10-60 to the touch is rough, because of hard hairs, adhesive stems, from the base, ramified, sometimes vilchat-high-erected, rising or prostrate green or that red-fingering with small lobes with a characteristic feature of a characteristic feature is the pubescence of leaves with simple and glandular hairs with another or virtative The location from dark to light green is no yes no, no actinomorphic flowers, 5-8 member pinkish and lilac 10 umbrellas and low-flowered curls consists of 5 dry single-seeded fruits, located around the base of the flower axis that are strongly increased up, squeezed from 2 sides of the brown seeds from a spiral appendage. Types with a uterine and rod root system, there is no rhizome from June to September, yes, there are no better on sandy soil from 6.6 to 8.5 Adult plants of the Aystnik do not require regular watering, but young shoots with a lack of moisture die most often during the growing season, carry out 1-2 top dressing with nitroammofoos or other complex mineral fertilizer drying old leaves and fading flowers and inflorescences remove the sun-loving easily tolerate the heat of the soil and dryness of the soil unpretentious The average average individual species need heat shelter, but there are also quite frost -resistant representatives The air temperature is undisclucing 6 (from -23 ° to -18 °) with seeds, division of the bush, cuttings are practically not damaged by diseases and pests of the Aistnik ordinary -this is herbaceous (less often half -brown) plant geranium. It can be either annual or growing in one place for many years. The culture has several synonyms of the name, the most common of which:\n\n\n\t\n\trobber;\n\t\n\t\n\tCycut crane;\n\t\n\t\n\tcrane nose;\n\t\n\t\n\tI needle. Aistnik in the wild Widely distributed in moderate and subtropical zones, prefers the steppe zones, sometimes grows in the northern regions. This plant is found in all countries of Europe, in the southern part of Africa and in Australia. There are both medium -sized species of aishtnik and completely dwarf. In the first case, the height of the plant reaches half a meter or more (up to 60 cm), in the second it does not exceed 10 cm. The stems of rough, adhesive, branched by the ground can be erect or creeping. In some species The stem with age changes the green color to a reddish tint.\n\nEmerald foliage has a rich shade, in some cases it is light green. There is no variegation. The leaves are pubescent, on the stems are located opposite.\n\nThe root system varies depending on the type. The rhizome can be finite or rod.\n\nAistnik forms umbrella or low -flowered inflorescences. The coloring of the flowers is different, most often lilac, pink and raspberry varieties are found. But flowers can To be white, creamy with burgundy stripes, pale blue, purple. Blooming in June, Aistnik will delight with long flowering until the fall, including all September, if the weather is warm. The touching flowers strewing the green pillow of the foliage look charming in rockery, mini-alpinearians, picturesquely decorate the crevices between large boulders. Gradually growing, the Aistnik gives the rocky area a special type of corner of wildlife. There are more than 120 species in nature Aystnik. The following varieties are especially popular in landscape design:\n\n\n\t\n\tAistnik Reichard-a reference view with a dense pillow of foliage, white-pink flowers with purple veins; Aistnik is an unpretentious plant that can easily endure drought and heat. For planting, it is preferable to choose the areas well -lit areas between the stones or along the slope of the alpine hill. The culture is best grows on sandy soil with an acidity of 6.6-8.8 pH. Plant care includes Standard events.\n\n\n\t\n\tRegular watering is required only to young seedlings for better rooting. Adult specimens are quite natural precipitation.\n\t\n\t\n\tFertening is made a couple of times in the growing season, using nitroammophosa or similar fertilizers.\n\t\n\t\n\tPruning is carried out as buds bloom in order to maintain a decorative type of plant. Propagate the Aistnik in any convenient way:\n\n\n\t\n\tdivision of the bush - an extensive root system gives good survival;\n\t\n\t\n\tcuttings - Spring procedure, cut the cuttings of 10 cm and root in the sand or peat;\n\t\n\t\n\tSeeds - the fruits are collected in September, sown in spring for seedlings. Aistnik is practically not susceptible to diseases and pest attacks. However, the danger is a waterlogging of the soil. During the period of prolonged rains or with frequent watering of sliding -loving plants growing nearby, the Aistnik can be infected with fungi. In this case, rotting of the root system is not excluded. Ordinary Aistnik is widely used in folk Medicine for the preparation of tinctures. They are used inward and externally, but more by superstition than in valid benefits. The plant will bring much more benefit in landscape design.|||Acanthus, Acantus, Acanf, Acanfa, Bear Lap, Bear Claw, Acanthacae Ostanist (Acanthaceae) Acantan grow in the regions of the Old World, with the greatest species density in the region of the Mediterranean and Asia in the wild, acanthi grow in the forests and thickets A half -brown, herbaceous plant perennial grow in tropical and subtropical regions, garden is self -sufficient in solitary plantings and popular no from 40 to 200 erect leaves Multiple prickly cirround-gaped or dissected smooth or with spikes along the edge of dark green no no no, and with prickly bracts, white or purple cylindrical brushes, which is sharply opened when ripening, scattering seeds over long distances (up to 10 m) a powerful cornf July-August up to 4 weeks no, no solar open areas of well-drained soils rich in humus with neutral or reduced acidity Moderate, as necessary regularly, it is enough to apply comprehensive fertilizers for garden plants once a month to regularly remove faded inflorescences and dried leaves of a sun -loving plant can tolerate a short drought for some types of frost -resistant young seedlings, it is recommended to cover the first few years with a spruent gun or other materials; Adult plants tolerate frosts well, but in harsh snowless winters also require shelter by no seeds, Cuts, dividing the bush is affected by powdery mildew Acanthus (Acanthus) belongs to decorative deciduous plants, among which there are half -brushes. Acanth stalks are straight, in low -growing varieties they reach 40 cm, and in high - up to 2 m. The leaf plates are located on elongated petioles, form a rather voluminous outlet. They can be ciriable or dissected, with sharp peaks. The color is dark green, often there are thorns on them. Acant is quite large numbers, many varieties are cultivated in gardening, and some as indoor plants. Mostly in greenhouses the heat -loving plant species are grown: stupid and battery -leaved. Acanth stupid has other names - mollis or soft. The plant does not differ in particular height and reaches 70 cm, although in the natural environment it can grow up to 150 cm. Large leaf plates have a length of 30-60 cm and width 7-15 cm, they form a fairly voluminous basic outlet painted in Dark green color. The leaves have a beautiful shape, they are roughly cut with a shiny surface. Unlike other types of acanthor, soft is characterized by the absence of thorns. Acantt does not tolerate transplants poorly, so the place for landing should be chosen taking into account all the preferences of the plant. A well -lit area protected from drafts, as well as with the presence of restrictions for the roots, is optimally suitable, since they are able to grow very much. It is also necessary that there be around the bush Free space, because growing, the acanthus acquires rather voluminous forms. The soil for planting is light and preferably with good moisture permeability, not acidic. You can make a suitable composition yourself. To do this, you need to take: 1 part of the humus; 1 part peat; 1 part of the sod land; 0.5 parts of the sand. The plant is not very whimsical and does not need special care. He needs weeding, loosening and mulching, which will help maintain the appearance of the bush and build up green mass. Watering is best done with warm water, in the summer, two abundant moisturizations per week are enough for him. In the cold period, the plant is also watered, but much less often. Acant is good resistance to diseases and damage by parasites. However, with excessive humidity, powder from powdery mildew can suffer (the appearance on the leaf plates of whitish plaque). In case of damage, diseased parts are removed, and the plant is sprayed with fungicides. In order to prevent prevention, it should be periodically thinned out A flower so that the air has access to the middle of the bush. Also, with high humidity, snails or slugs may appear on the plant, they are assembled mechanically and watering is adjusted. Acantan can be diluted in several ways: seeds;|||Acanthocalycium cactus acanthocalycyumium is common in Argentina (Salta, Qatamark, Tukuman and Cordoba) grow in clefts of rocks and in gentle mountain meadows, at an altitude of cactus indoor and depending on the type of 10-60 from the balloons to cylindrical light or dark green and dark-green yes Yes, yes the average 3-6 funky, wide open fruits are dark green, spherical, about 2 cm into the diameter large, from dark brown to black usually occurs in the summer when the diameter of the cactus at least 6 cm permeable, mainly sore, contains up to 30 % –40 % of sand and small gravel pH about 5.6 during the growing season regular heat -loving spring need mild shading, in the summer - in a large amount of sunlight, unpretentious winter content at a temperature of 8-10 ° C acanthocalyicium, or Acanthocalycium, is a kind cacti from the family of cactus. These exotic plants grow in Argentina, where they can be found in the regions of Salta, Qatamark, Tukuman and Cordoba. Acantocaliciums attract attention not only with their unusual shape and coloring of the stems, but also with beautiful colors. They are ideal for indoor growing due to their unpretentiousness and decorative qualities. Culture can vary in height from 10 to 60 cm, depending on a specific type. The stems of cacti can be spherical or cylindrical, with coloring from light to dark green. On the surface of the stems are thorns or spikes that The plant gives the plant a characteristic species. The flow of acantocalcium occurs in the summer when the diameter of the cactus reaches at least 6 cm. Flowers have an average size - from 3 to 6 cm, and are characterized by a funnel -shaped form, as well as wide open petals. The fruits of this plant are dark green spherical formations with a diameter of about 2 cm. The seeds are large and can have shades from dark brown to black. Acantocalicium care does not require much effort - this unpretentious plant is suitable Even for beginner gardeners. However, there are certain requirements for the conditions of its content. For successful growth, it is necessary to use permeable soil with a predominance of sod land. It is also recommended to add sand and small gravel (up to 30-40% of the total). The acidity of the soil should be about 5-6 pH. The temperature. Acantocaliciums are thermophilic, the optimum temperature for the winter content is 8-10 ° C. In the spring, the plant requires a slight shade, and in the summer It needs a large amount of sunlight for full development. Polves. During the period of active vegetation, watering should be regular. It is important to ensure that the water does not stagnate at the roots.|||Alsteremerii, Alstromeria, Peruvian Lilia, Lilia Incas, Alstroemeria Alstrainty Alstraemia The Rod Is the Rod is covered by almost all of South America. The greatest species diversity is observed in the Andes. Alsteremeri is found in the attack in Chile, and in Bolivia and Peru in the tropical forests, in the desert, and in the highlands, the grassy plant is a perennial, tropical garden, beautifully flowering decorative plant, the starch obtained from the roots of Alstrameriy. He finds The use in folk medicine, and is also used for the preparation of high -quality glue and flexible, erects are located mostly in the upper part of the stem whole, linear thin, curved next and zygomorphic, collected in umbrella inflorescences on the tops of the stalks of yellow, pink, red, often with spots (usually yellow) 6 spatulas or lanceolate with narrow bases 6 are long, free, with a short pubescence in the base elongated, are opened by a lateral longitudinal gap Umbrella box, opened completely, from the top to the base, numerous, spherical, with abundant endosperm and small straight embryos, juicy roots, spindle -shaped rhizomes, tuber spring and summer relatively quickly fall the petals of a well -fertilized, drained sour, all types of alstheromeria transfers small negative temperatures [description should be started with the fact that culture should start with the culture that culture It is perennial. This is a herbaceous plant with tuberous roots. The stem is straight, flexible. Typically, the height varies from 80 to 200 cm, although there are also stunted varieties. The flowers of the culture are luxurious. The diameter of each can reach 5-6 cm. The coloring is different. There are snow-white, delicate and bright pink, yellow, orange, purple, red flowers. At the same time, there are varieties combining 2 or 3 shade in each flower at once. A characteristic feature of culture, regardless of the variety, are thin small strips on the petals. To date, there are many types and varieties of this culture. Consider the most popular. Virginia. This is one of the most favorite varieties grown for bouquets. Snow -white wavy petals form delicate flowers, spectacularly released against the background of greens. Such flowers grow up to 70 cm. Flowering begins in June. The time suitable for planting culture in open ground depends on the region. The procedure is carried out after the end of the frost. It is necessary that the soil warms up to 20 degrees and the air temperature is also stabilized. In many areas Countries such conditions appear in late May. In some places, landing is carried out in early June. The site in the garden should be selected well -lit. It is better that a light partial shade is formed there during the day. Well, if the place is protected from the wind. The soil should be nutritious, well permeable. Acidity must be selected weak or neutral. Theam is made about 30 cm deep. The optimal width of the planting deepening is from 40 to 50 cm. It is important that the roots of the young plant are placed In the hole freely. A drainage layer is laid on the bottom. A rotten compost is placed on top of it. The thickness of the layer should be about 7-8 cm. Consider several important stages of care for Alstromeria. Most often, alstromeria is propagated by seeds or dividing the bush. We will analyze each of these methods separately. It is better to put indoor alstriently on the southern windowsill. There she will be there all the time except summer. In hot weather, the flower should be cleaned in a shaken cool place. The maximum temperature that the plant can withstand without losing decorativeness is 28 degrees. Despite the fact that the culture is thermophilic, the close placement of convectors in winter is also undesirable. The heaters dry the air, which negatively affects the colors. If you decide to decorate the balcony or loggia with the plant, then remember that the minimum allowable temperature level is 10 degrees. In the cold, the culture will not bloom, and if the thermometer mark falls too low, the flower may die. Culture can affect a fungal infection. This usually happens with excess watering. The most common ailments are root rot and late blight. In the first case, the foliage begins to turn yellow. You can also notice rot at the base of the stem. In the second case, the foliage loses the juiciness of the color and fester. In both situations, the processing of all parts of the flower (including the root system) with fungicides is necessary. For this, the culture is dug. However, treatment can only help at the initial Stages of the disease. If the situation is launched, the plant will have to be destroyed. As for the pests, then there are several dangers for alstromeria. The presence of a spider mite can be identified by light spots and a web on the green part of the plant. In the case of such a trouble, the flower is 3 times treated with acaricides. Between the procedures, the interval is observed in the decade. With tripps, they fight with the help of the drug \"Confidor\". You can determine the existence of a problem by silver traces on the foliage. Prevention of attacks Slugs are carried out by scattering around a flower of chopped eggs of an egg or wood bark. Low varieties of culture are often used to decorate walking paths, flower beds. Low -growing varieties grown in pots are carried into the garden for the period of summer. They are placed at places of rest, in open arbors. High alstromerias become a spectacular background for other flowering and just green crops.|||Alternanthera, legged amaranth (amaranthaceae) alternanter, most species of the genus are found in the tropical regions of North and South America, some come from tropical Asia, a grassy perennial plant, an annual tropical and subtropical garden, there are no creeping and bedsous to elaboxes. There are no whole species floating in the water column of water, from lanceolate to ovoid mental and white or yellow small 3-5 cylindrical The spike-shaped or tubid bags of double-convex or ovoid-long-term there are no unpretentious alternanter is an annual or many years of herbaceous plant, sometimes a small half-brush. This vegetation belongs to the Amaranth family. She boasts high decorative qualities. Alternanter is most often found in tropical regions of South and North America. Some varieties can be seen in the territory of tropical Asia. Alternanter has a beautiful appearance. The stems of the plant can be creeping, lying, erect. In some varieties, they floating in the water column. There are no thorns and spikes on the stems.\n\nListen plates are whole -edge. Their shape can be lanceolate, ovoid. The placement of leaves is opposite.\n\nFlowers can have a yellow or white color. They differ in small sizes. Each flower can have 3-5 stamens. Inflorescences have a cylindrical spike or head form.\n\nThe flowers are bisexual. They have a perianth's film leaves. The latter can be uneven.\n\nThe fruits are small bags. There are seeds in them. The latter have a biconvex or ovoid-long-term shape. Most often, an alternator is used to decorate artificial and natural reservoirs, as well as flower beds. This decorative vegetation will look great in group plantings, next to other bright crops. Next, we will get acquainted in more detail with features of individual species of this decorative plant.\n\n\n\t\n\tAlternanter Rhinek. This species is considered the most common. It is very often used in aquarium. In a natural environment, vegetation grows like a surface floating plant. This alternanter is a perennial herbaceous look with creeping stems. This culture has a high growth rate of shoots. With proper and timely care, it grows by 15 centimeters monthly. Leafy The plates of plantings are sedentary, their length can reach 4 centimeters, and the width is 2 cm. The surface of the foliage is rounded with even edges. Alternanter will be able to fully grow and develop in well -lit territories. Although there are individual species that prefer shaded areas. For such decorative vegetation, the optimal temperature regime is 18-28 degrees of heat (in winter at least 14 degrees of heat). These decorative plants can be grown as in open ground, and at home. In any case, this culture will need moderate watering with warm water. On hot days of landing, it will be necessary to moisturize more abundantly. On cool and non -solid days, it is necessary, on the contrary, to reduce the volume of water during irrigation. Strongly cannot be allowed to water the soil. Otherwise, gray mold will begin to form on plantations.\n\nThis culture must be fed in the spring-summer season. Moreover, fertilizers should be applied once every two weeks. For These plantings can be used both organic and mineral top dressing. In the winter and autumn, there is no need to feed plantations.\n\nThe alternanter grows quite quickly, so it must be regularly trimmed. In this case, it will be possible to give landings the desired neat form, prevent an excessive growth of culture. You can propagate such a culture throughout the growing season. You can breed an alternator with a bush division and cuttings. The first method is most often It is used when the vegetation has already grown. The bush will need to be carefully divided into several separate fragments. Moreover, each of them should have roots.\n\nThe second method of propagation is considered more common. Cuttings are cut off from plantings at a slight angle. The lower leaves are removed from them. After that, the resulting material is planted in the ground, deepening to the first leaf. The soil is slightly bulged. Further, all this is covered with a jar and put in a warm place. After the appearance of new ones Leafers can transplant vegetation to a permanent place. Alternanter has very strong immunity. Infections occasionally do not affect the culture.\n\nSometimes an alternanter can suffer due to insect pests, in particular, from aphids, whiteflies, spider mites. These parasites easily suck plant juices and eat plant tissues. As a result, plantings lose their original decorative appearance, become very weak. To withdraw all dangerous pests, you can Make planting processing with a simple soap solution. If this does not help, then you will have to use special purchased drugs - insecticides.\n\nAnd also vegetation can suffer due to violations of growing conditions. So, with insufficient illumination, the brightness and saturation of leaf plates are lost. With too bright light on leaf plates, burns can form. Experienced gardeners advise from time to time to carry out preventive examinations of these decorative data plantations.|||Amberboa Astrus (Asteraceae) and 9 species of a grassy plant Annature, a biennet as a decorative plant on austor from 20 to 80 is sometimes very shortened, covered with short curly hairs or completely branched erect, ease uniform and lower stem leaves of petioles, the upper usually sitting, usually sitting, from solid and gear to peristool -packed and peristrostal, not lowering on the stem is covered with short curly hairs or completely naked and thin, pleasant from June to September, if it is planned to grow seedlings in the room, the seeds are planted in April, in May you can plant seeds directly on the flowerbed with a nest for 2–4 seeds at a distance of 25-30 cm.

Only 6 species enter it. Honey culture can be an annual or biennial. The genus of ammonia plants is widespread in most of the world. He meets Mostly on the Mediterranean coast, in North Africa and Southern Europe. Under natural conditions, the AMMI genus grows on dry slopes and in salt -free steppes. The AMMI genus is characterized by the formation of a large sprawling bush. The height of straight hollow stems on average is 120 centimeters. Plants that are very branching in the upper part are covered with a small foliage of a rich green shade. The petiole leaflets have an unusual shape and are divided into 2-3 narrow slices. On leafy The plates are observed in the form of sharp teeth.\n\nSmall bisexual flowers are collected in inflorescences. Sherrovoid umbrella formations are painted in a white or yellowish tint. In the diameter, they reach 10-15 centimeters. Double-packed or back-heart-shaped petals are narrowed to the base in short nails. The cup teeth are small, but prominent.

Upon completion, the fetus is cracking and decaying into 2 rounded parts, each of which is characterized by the presence of 5 acute filamentary ribs.\n\nThe plant has a rod root system with strong central root and thin side processes. Due to the fact that the root leaves deeply In the ground, culture can experience long periods of drought. Flowering of plants of the Ammony genus usually occurs from July to August or early September, lasts about 40 days. On each plant, up to 4 thousand buds bloom. The life expectancy of each reaches 6-7 days. AMMI is not particularly involved in the landscaping of the surrounding space, but 3-4 plants can be planted in a flowerbed, in a flower garden or mixborder. The most famous species of the genus are considered ammy large and ammi toothache.\n\nThe large AMMI forms a large annual, the height of which ranges from 100 to 150 centimeters.

A well -lit, rather spacious place is selected for the culture. In the shaded areas, the plants will be stretched, but do not increase in width at all. In addition, without enough light, flowering becomes scarce, and fruiting, in general, ceases. To a similar result leads and Excess air humidity during flowering.\n\nOptimal for culture are western or southern orientation on the site. Some types are required up to several hours of direct sunlight, but others will be able to successfully develop in partial shade. If representatives of the genus AMMI, high plants with numerous side processes, lack free space, their inflorescences smaller and lose their decorativeness.

In the presence of fertile soil on the area of ​​fertile soil, you can not feed the bushes.\n\nWhen caring for moinia It is worth devoting time to regular weeds, since weeds take useful elements necessary for plants from the soil, and, in addition, spoil its appearance. Thin leaves are quickly restored after wind or rain, they do not need a garter. Blue prayer can be diluted with both seeds and vegetatively. Blue prayer is characterized by high resistance to diseases and insect damage. Preventive treatment with fungicides and insecticides will be reliable protection of the plant, they Many -year -old people will be protected from many problems. In areas with frequent weather change and regular rains, bushes should be treated with fungicidal drugs in order to prevent fungal diseases. It is enough to take such measures once a month.\n\nIn hot periods, the plant can be affected by a spider mite, the struggle with it consists in spraying the plant with insecticides, they also treat the plant in spring and autumn for prevention. Quite often unprocessed bushes damage the larvae of the Khrushchi, and Also scoops and bark beets.|||Euphorbia Grantii, Synadenium Grantii, Synadenium Umbellatum, Euphorbia Umbellata in Tropical Africa: Zambezi Valina, West Kenya, Uganda, on the banks of Lake Tanganyka, widely resettle and naturalized in the tropical regions of the Earth. The perennial tree is used as a hedge, the tall bush is not fast in nature up to 300 (it happens up to 500-1000), in room culture it rarely exceeds 150 erects branches from the base to 12-15 cm On the old parts of the plant, the cortex is grayish young branches rounded in cross section, cylindrical, naked, fleshy, 8-20 mm thick, and green, green with a reddish tint or backy-shaped and vicious to the wrecked top with a dull tip, large 14-20 2.5-7 gathered, thicken and lignify. bundles at the ends of the branches, the next; at the base are covered with rare hairs; the surface of the sheet is naked on both sides; mesh The uniform-green protrudes on the lower side of the sheet, there is darker along the veins, the lower side is pale green no no, there are no small 1-3 red axillary or apical, of 2-5 loose false umbrellas, 7-15 cm long (3-5 cm), 5-10 cm wide, finely condominated from above, a naked amount of 7 x 8 mm, pubescent, pubescent, pubescent, pubescent, pubescent, pubescent, reduced, pubescence The stalk of about 5 mm long, 3-nesting, opening, contains 3 oval seeds, 2.5 x 2 mm in size, covered with small tubercles, rudimentary milestone in winter or early In the spring, the garden, the photophilous room tolerates the dry air of the rooms in the winter in the plant, the period of relative rest, should not be allowed to drop a temperature below +10 ° C requires well -drained soil with the addition of sand or perlite abundant, in the breaks between the irrigation of the soil, it is recommended to form a rare crown and it is recommended to form seedlings and booties on the bottom of the pot. a layer of gravel as a drainage in indoor conditions quite stable, pests are marked with powdery worm, shields and a web of a tick; With overflow and stagnation of water, root rot and falling of the leaves are possible in the departure of all parts of the plant are extremely poisonous, when eating can cause the death of the grant synadenium in an official source is called Synadenium Grantii, and it is often not only compared, but also confused with the milk of a white -fat type. In fact, this is also wholly, only another subspecies. There is definitely visual resemblance With a traditional representative, but there is a difference - the texture of the foliage, which in the Synidenium Grant has a pronounced pubescence. In general, synadeniums are territorially located in the South African regions in the wild. There are many species of this plant, but it is the grant variety that is in demand around the world.\n\nMost often, the flower grows in home greenhouses, since it is difficult to do in open ground due to climate features. This subspecies is recommended for flower growers of completely different levels, including For beginners. Many mistakenly consider the consonance of the synadenium and adenium to attribute a grant and a desert rose to one species. At home, the grant is growing and developing excellently provided that the competent agricultural technology and the accounting of features during landing. First of all, you need to choose the right soil. Sukkulents in general are not particularly picky in this matter, but this type requires loose, neutral soil with good breathability. You can make a soil mixture yourself, for this In equal proportions, peat is connected to leaf -type ground and large sand. You need to add wood ash, which protects the root system from rot, attacks of harmful bacteria.\n\nThe container for planting must certainly be drained, for which they create a layer of clay fragments, expanded clay. Brick crumbs affects the ground well, it prevents stagnation of water. Since the plant develops rapidly, the moment comes when it is closely in the usual capacity. During this period, the grant is transplanted to a large container with obligatory holes for drainage below. The algorithm for landing and transplantation is identical:\n\n\n\tA wide layer of drainage is formed at the bottom;\n\tFill out by the soil mixture half;\n\tThe old or new plant is cleaned of an earthen coma, but not too actively;\n\tThen it is inserted into the pot, the roots are straightened, the substrate is filled in such a way that a centimeter of free space remains to the top of the container;\n\tIf necessary, when transplanting, part of the roots is cut off;\n\tPlanting and trimming procedure is carried out Necessarily on gloves. Propagate this plant in two ways - cuttings and seeds.\n\n\n\tCherging. To obtain cuttings, sprouts are cut at least 10 cm long, a maximum of 15 cm. They are removed from the top of the plant, and leaves should be present in a small amount. The cut place should be sprinkled with crushed activated coal, and let it dry. Когда там сформируется нечто вроде пленки, отросток ставят в грунт, состоящий из торфа и песка, углубляя примерно на 2,5 см. Почву Previously, calcined in the oven for disinfection. Then the container is rearranged in a zone with good lighting, where it is really possible to maintain a temperature of about +20 degrees. After the appearance of fresh shoots, we can assume that the seedling is rooted, it can be transplanted to a permanent place in a suitable soil mixture\n\tSeed method. This method requires more time and effort, so it is used only by flower growers with extensive experience. The procedure is carried out only in the spring. First prepared The container with a mixture of peat and sand on which the seeds are located. They sprinkle them on top with a sandy layer, the thickness of which is about 1 centimeter. Then the soil is moistened with a spray gun, and covered with a glass lid. After about a couple of weeks, shoots will appear, the glass is removed. When the seedlings stretch up to 10 cm, they are dive for the first stage. Since plants are very toxic, pests are most often not terrible for him. But various diseases can cause flower growers a lot unpleasant minutes. But almost all problems arise due to illiterate agricultural technology, in general, the immunity of the plant is good. Each problem can be prevented or fixed.\n\n\n\tDrops the leaves. Most likely, the flower survived temperature changes, or watering standards are violated: watering is rare, cold water. It is necessary to fix these two points, and remove the damaged parts.\n\tThe turgor is reduced or lost. The plant lacks water, so it is necessary to normalize moisture.\n\tThe shoots stretch too much. The flower is not enough light, you need to cut it, and put it in a suitable area.\n\tSpider mite. Use acaricidal compositions or a solution of soap. It is important to take care of the humidity in the room."

The birthplace of the flower is Southeast Asia. He arrived in our latitudes from the expanses of China, the Philippine Islands, New Guinea, India or even Sumatra. The range of her habitat in natural conditions is quite extensive. As an indoor plant, Aglanema has gained its popularity due to brightness, beautiful color and interesting flowers.\n\nAglanema belongs to the same aroid family along with Diffenbachia. Hence the confidence of many that it is as poisonous as And her larger family sister. In Aglaonema, like other plants of the aroid family, the flower looks like a small earnings, which is enveloped in a “bedspread” from a light green canvas, similar to a delicate sheet. The final type of flower depends largely on the type of aglaonema and can be of different shapes and size. There are not today a lot of varieties of Aglaonem. If you list them all, more than 50. Among them, hybrid varieties are also found.\n\nThe most famous Types of Aglaonem, on the basis of which many varieties are displayed.\n\n\n\tAglanema is simple. The most typical representative of the species. It grows in nature mainly in the swamps and grows no higher than 35 cm. The leaflets of simple aglaonems on average reach up to 17 cm in length and 7 cm in width. They are single-color and most often dark green. Since Aglaonema came to us from a width with a tropical climate, special conditions are required to keep it at home. If they ignore them and not provide the flower all necessary, there is a chance to kill him.\n\nIt is very important to provide the following things at the proper level:\n\n\n\tlighting;\n\tTemperature and humidity. Aglanema is a plant that grows very slowly, so the transplant is not a frequent event for him. For these colors, it is also important to make a transplant periodically to update the soil. But this is done much less often than for other indoor plants.\n\nYoung flowers transplant no more than once a year, and on average, the frequency can reach one and a half years. Adult plants are transplanted once every 3-5 years.\n\nThe most favorable time for transplanting is late spring. Aglanema loves wide pots. Instead of the soil, you need to use the soil mixture, which includes 1 part of the humus, 6 parts of leaves, 2 parts of sand and peat, 1 part of charcoal. You can also use a substrate consisting of 1 part of the sand, 1 part of peat and 2 parts of sheet ground with the addition of a small amount of charcoal. Watering and top dressing - two important components caring for agglondia at home. The watering mode cannot be violated, and top dressing cannot be ignored. Then the plant will receive the necessary level of moisture and all the substances necessary for it for a full life and development.\n\nYou can not water the plant with water directly from under the tap. The water is required soft. To soften water per 1 liter, add 0.2 grams of oxalic acid. It can be replaced with lemon. The solution must be defended for at least a day before use. Watering with cold water is contraindicated, better Use water at room temperature or even slightly warm. Propagation is best carried out in late spring or summer. Otherwise, it is necessary to use a mini-tile to provide the cuttings with heat and protect against possible temperature drops.\n\nThe main safety rule when working with agglondia during its reproduction, when it has to be cut, is the protection of the skin of the hands. It is best to use protective gloves, and after contact with the cuts of the plant, the hands must be thoroughly washed with soap. Like any living creature, Aglaonem can feel bad, and this will certainly affect its viability. It is not subject to disease, but can be attacked by insects. She also suffers greatly from improper care.\n\nIt is important to do everything possible to determine the causes of malaise and exclude them, as well as provide the necessary treatment, if necessary. If nothing is done, the plant may die. Because any violations in its functioning are attempts Seeing that something is wrong with him.\n\nIf the plant began to twist the leaves, then most likely it froze. If the foliage twisted into the tube, and the edges of the leaves began to darken, these are the symptoms of the same problem. You need to see if the temperature in the room has fallen, and check if the pot came into a draft.\n\nThe leaves of the aglaonema were covered with light-yellow spots or specks atypical for its species-most likely, the flower has a burn. It is urgent to remove the pot with the plant from under the sun And provide him with the necessary partial shade. If you moisturize the leaves with qualitatively, spraying them with warm soft water, they will recover."

It refers to wood cacti of the Kutov family. Africa, as well as the island of Sokotra, is considered the birthplace of adenium. In addition, the plant can be found on the Arabian Peninsula. Now in nature there are more than 50 species of this plant, which can grow even up to 10 meters. However, this is possible only in the natural habitat. At home, only adenium can be grown. There are several varieties of adenium, of which it is registered so far Only 12. Some of them are very popular. To replenish your knowledge, it is necessary to consider all these varieties in more detail. Mini. This small subspecies of adenium differs in that it grows quite slowly. In addition, flowers on one bush can have a completely different shade. All this is due to the fact that different varieties of this plant are instilled on one trunk. Such succulents will feel great at home and in huge offices. But for this to them It is necessary to create certain conditions that consist in compliance with the temperature regime, the correct selection of the substrate and other conditions. For adenium, timely transplant is very important, which is necessary to do annually with the onset of spring. But this is relevant only for young succulent. But for an adult plant, transplantation is required only 1 time every 3 years. To do this, you need to choose a rather low container, in addition, it should be wider. Best if the pot is from Plastic, because it does not heat up as much under the sun as ceramic flowerpots. The plant must be carefully removed and lightly shake the ground. After that, you can start landing in a new substrate. It is necessary to water the plant after transplantation only when the soil is completely dry. Growing adenium at home is not so difficult. The main thing is to provide him with proper care, which will be by force even to beginner gardeners. After all, this is a completely unpretentious plant that does not require special skills. If the pruning topic is already affected, then it must be said that it is done not only to increase the number of flowers on this mini-carrier. This process is possible in the following cases. It is service that the handsome adenium ceases to bloom. In this case, you can carry out such a procedure. Most likely it is necessary to create a beautiful, luxurious crown. The root pruning is also possible to simplify the transplant process a little. Any parts of the flower are also cut, which have signs that have signs diseases. To propagate the adenium, you can use several ways at once. Often this is done with apical cuttings, vaccination on Oleander or the second adenium, as well as seeds. All processes are best carried out in the spring, when the plant only wakes up. Very often it can be seen that the tips dry on a mini-ruff, leaves turn yellow, and sometimes completely fall off. All this can happen due to the appearance of some diseases. Most often it is an excess of moisture. In this case, fungal defeat. Then the root system of the plant suffers, which is very susceptible to this. To prevent this from happening, it is necessary to make a drainage layer thicker. In some cases, part of the affected roots is simply cut and disinfected. One can also occur due to the appearance of viral infections. This will not kill the plant, however, it will begin to “die” very slowly. At first, the flower just looks worse, and then drops all the leaves. It is almost impossible to deal with such problems, Therefore, the only thing to do is destroy infected plants, while preferably with a flowerpot."

The birthplace of most ferns is South America and East Asia. In conditions of tropical and subtropical climate of these hemispheres, plants feel great and develop perfectly. In the nature of our country there are two types of adyantum - Adiantum Capillus Veneris (Venus of Hair) and Adiatum Pedatum (adyantum Stoopoid). The common features of all types of adyanthums are: thin creeping roots; low growth (not exceeding 60 cm); dissected drooping leaves (vaiy) located on dark shiny petioles; spores that are on the lower side of the leaf plates. Adiantums delight with their splendor and charm. In regions with a temperate climate, where there are no sharp fluctuations in temperatures in the winter, they can take root in the open soil. Adiantum is most often planted as an indoor plant. Consider the rules of landing at home. It is better to buy copies in a flower store in the spring-summer period, so that you can immediately transplant a pot. In stores, adiantums are usually implemented in containers with standard flower soil, but these plants need an improved soil composition. The preparation of the substrate should take care in advance. It is necessary to prepare a mixture consisting of equal parts: fertile land, humus and 1/3 of the sand. In the absence of humus, it can be replaced with peat. Flower care at home is completely simple. He prefers partial shade and wet air, so pots should be placed on the windowsills of the northern and eastern part of the apartment or in the depths of the rooms. A great option is placement near the aquarium, a decorative fountain, a humidifier of air or other moisture source. Propagate flowers with the following methods. Sporas. Formed on the inside of the leaf Plates Spores are suitable for reproduction. Disputes usually ripen in late August and retain their properties for several years. They need to be carefully assembled and spread on a sheet of paper. When they dried, they are cleaned for storage. It is more convenient to store in paper envelopes. In the spring you can prepare for their sowing. For this, a shallow container is selected, which is filled with a substrate of peat, sand and fertile land. The soil for disinfection must be packed with boiling water. As soon as the earth has cooled Superficially planted seeds and cover the container with glass or plastic film. The germination period of seeds in a warm room on average is 6-8 weeks. When small sprouts appear, glass (film) is removed, and the container is placed in a bright place that is not available for direct sunlight. The grown shoots dive into separate cups. Subject to all the rules for the content of the adyantum, they feel well and delight the owners of their beautiful foliage. But in case of violation of the conditions of content The plant can acquire a painful appearance, which is manifested in indoor adyanthums in the following signs. The leaves of leaves. The reasons lies most often in the fact that direct sunlight or the roots have grown strongly on the leaves, that the flower has become crowded. Changing the location and transplanting to a larger container will help to eliminate the problem.|||Setcreasea pallida, setcreasea purpurea, purple lily, a violet queen plant, a violet inch plant tradescantia setcreasia (pallida, pale) colorful tropical, ampelous zigzag -shaped long, brittle, with a thin layer Dark purple, purple purple indirect indirect, grows perfectly at a normal room temperature from 12 to 24 ° C, but not lower than 10 degrees Celsius is well drained, not to the composition of the substrate It is demanding moderate, without stagnation of water at the roots in the spring and summer, bring the universal fertilizer of weak concentration at once or twice a month, pinching and pruning of long stems, as necessary, does not like drafts from the middle of autumn, can be kept in coolness (about +15 ° C) in the conditions of proper care is practically not affected by the purple setcanasy, pale, Purpureaa is practically affected setcreasea) is an evergreen perennial, characterized by long stems and pointed leaves. She relates To the family of the commune. A wild setcreasia grows in the east of Mexico, on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Today it is often used as a garden plant in tropics and subtropics, and in temperate latitudes it is a home flower. Quite rare, but still not exotic. Description of setcreasia:\n\n\n\tan ampel plant that can reach 80 cm in length in a couple of years (and then the growth will stop);\n\tThe leaves grow in a checkerboard pattern, the form is broad -headed;\n\tThe inside of the leaflets with small whitish villi;\n\tThe stems and surface of the sheet plates-the royal purple color, as the foliage is aged, it will fade, it will become weakly turquoise;\n\tShe has powerful, fleshy stems;\n\tThe lower side of the leaves-saturated purple;\n\tSetreasia flowers are pink or pink-violet, 3 petals each;\n\tThe flowering period is long - from the beginning of spring to the end of summer.\n\n\nIf you want to extend the flowering period or at least support it, you need to break the flowers in a timely manner. By the way, the flower is partly can be considered therapeutic. It relieves pain during rheumatism: a sheet of setcreasia is heated and applied to a sore spot for 5 hours. And in order to quickly heal the wounds, the leaves of the plant are chopped to a slurry and applied to the inflamed area. The flower is also considered an excellent absorbent that absorbs harmful impurities from the air, that is, cleans it, moisturizes it. It also absorbs electromagnetic radiation, which is very important for modern apartments. To grow this flower at home, you need to choose Suitable view. The indoor plant can be the following varieties.\n\n\n\tGreen. Light green leaves are not the most common option for this culture. Their leaf records are pointed on tops, and with a petiole, they cover the stem around the circumference. When flowering, small white flowers collected in bunches will appear.\n\tPurple. In this species, the pubescent of the leaves is very noticeable. The upper side is crimson, but the lower is purple. The shoots have the falling internodes. The buds are pink or pinkish with purple. This plant is almost always cultivated as an ampel culture.\n\tVariegate. On the leaf plates of this plant, mutated cells of a lighter color are visible. And these zones give a flower of originality. And so that this feature does not pass, you can not process the plant with mineral complexes with a lot of nitrogen.\n\tStriped. Grassing shape with creeping stems. The leaves have an unusual color, on a purple basis - white longitudinal stripes, and the lower Part of the leaves has a delicate pink underon. Flowering is virtually invisible because the inflorescences are very small. Old shoots over time become fragile, brittle, can break under their own weight, even just from touch.\n\n\nThe purple variety of setcreasia has a box of a box. Plants planted in casop or vases, in various decorative containers suitable for this, the plants very quickly grow, form a thick mass. In the year, tradescantia pale grows about 30 cm, which quite a few. But over time, her decorativeness, alas, will be lost. Therefore, the flower must be artificially rejuvenated, and this is an important part of the care of it. It is better if the landing happens in late March - early April, at this time the growth potential is as high as possible. But if necessary, do not wait for a suitable deadline, you can plant and transplant. The plant is sufficiently tolerant of transplanting, calmly tolerates it.\n\nWhat else you need to know about the planting of setcreasia.\n\n\n\tCapacity. Both plastic and ceramic pots Come in, here is a matter of taste. Although it is worth considering that in ceramic evaporation is faster, since the material has pores. There must be drainage holes in the bottom of the container to establish an outflow of excess water. In height, the pot should be equal to the width, but it may be a little wider. And it must certainly be stable, because as soon as the flower grows, the capacity is easy to tip over.\n\tPriming. You can buy it ready, in a flower store or garden market. The main thing is that The soil mixture was loose and nutritious. And in order to increase loose to the desired indicators, perlite, vermiculite or large river sand are used. And one of the above is added in a share of 1/3 to the total volume, and then the soil is mixed. But you can make it yourself: mix the turf soil, compost, quartz sand (coarse) in equal shares, mix, add a little woody coal to suppress the development of the fungus.\n\tTechnique. At the bottom of the pot with a 5-centimeter layer is laid drainage. On top of it is the soil. Then they are most delicately laid out the roots so that they lie in different directions. The remaining space is filled with earth to the top of the container. The departure is complex, but not to say that it requires a lot of effort. Problems do not happen so often. For example:\n\n\n\tIf the old tradescantia leaves quickly die off, it is probably a matter of low air humidity, which is easily adjustable;\n\tIf the flower is stretched, small leaves are formed - there is little light;\n\tIf on the leaves Spots appear, probably, the fact is that after spraying there are droplets of moisture, and setcreasia is faced with a sunburn;\n\tIf the tips of the leaves dry out, it is a lack of moisture or a lack of space in a container.\n\n\nAnd all these points will warn standard care. This can be done in several ways. Consider reproduction options.\n\n\n\tSeeds. It is better to do this using moisturized sand. After planting, the container can be covered with glass or polyethylene. And during the period when the seeds They will germinate, you need to ventilate the sand and moisturize it when it dries.\n\tCuttings or side shoots. A sharp and sterile knife need to cut the top of the stem (better, 3-4 tops), where the leaves are healthy and strong. Then the sections should be sent to the water for rooting. However, instead of water, you can immediately take the soil mixture. And when the roots appear, plants with them, from 3 to 5 pieces, need to be planted in one pot.\n\tDividing the root. This process is convenient to combine with a transplant. The plant is careful They dig up so as not to injure the roots. Then the roots are cleaned of the ground and washed under cold water. The spine is divided into parts, planted in different containers.\n\n\nPropagation by stem cuttings is probably the most popular practice. Their length should be 8 cm. The lower leaves from the cuttings should be removed, the selected samples in the moistened mixture of peat and sand or just in a glass of water should be rooted. For a rooting can take almost a month, but often three weeks will be enough. In a glass of water it turns out Also successful. And the hiding stalks are well rooted and themselves, simply in contact with the soil. If there is no task to propagate the plant, but you want to get aiming another setcrease in the house, you can buy it. When buying, you need to evaluate the flower: it should be inherent in elasticity and the absence of all signs of wilting. It is also worthwhile to carefully examine the plant for pests - alas, it is not uncommon when the flower “brings” the pests on itself, and this is a store flower.\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting, for Pathogenes Sethcreasia is not the most coveted object. But the shield and a spider mite can hit the plant. The shield will help to overcome the soap-recipest solution, as well as a solution of soap and machine oil. Garlic solution and special products like Akarin and Fitoverm helps. And to save from a spider mite will help to wash the plant with soapy solution, garlic inhalations."

The people are also known as Goriztvet. Sometimes it is also called a hare poppy seed and a cheek.\n\nThe plant received its main name in honor of the lover of the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite. He was killed by jealous Ares. In the place where it spilled Blood, anemones have grown. And on the area where his body fell, the goddess ordered a beautiful yellow flower to bloom annually. He was named after his beloved Aphrodite.\n\nThe botanical description of this plant looks very simple. His rhizome is short, vertical. In height, the flower grows to 10-30 centimeters. His stems are smooth, almost naked. They can be both erect and rejected. Growing a flower in your garden is quite simple. To propagate this culture, you can Use not only seeds. Some gardeners propagate flowers with division of the bush. They do this in late summer or early autumn. For division, bushes are used at least 4-5 years old.\n\nThe selected plant is gently dug up. Its root is cleaned of the remnants of the Earth. Then the rhizome is carefully cut into several parts. Slices are carefully sprinkled with ashes.\n\nThe resulting Delens are immediately planted on a site with pre -moistened soil. They are planted at a distance of 30 centimeters from each other. After planting, the site is necessarily watered well.\n\nDo not allow Adonis's flowering in the first year after planting a division to a new place. Flowers must be removed. This is necessary so that the plant spends all efforts on rooting.|||Ámmi május, female lace, lace of the queen of Anna, lace plant, weed of the bishop, false weed of the bishop of ammoni amami, a large range of species covers the southern and southeastern Europe, Northern Africa, the near and Middle East. Naturalized everywhere. Half -breeding plant an annual plant, a biencetizer is ideal for creating a mixborder background, it will look great with cornflowers, poppies, dahlias, and can be used as an unsightly decorator of the fruit in the quality The quality of medicinal raw materials and an annual spring weed of the Mediterranean, growing from seeds and up to 50 naked, rounded, furrowed straight first petioles, upper lanceolate doubles or troyak-operated small umbrellas up to 10 ovytlosdniks, decaying into two half-sides, compressed from the sides, naked, smooth, smooth 2.5 mm rod from the end of June-July until September in September grows preferably on dry, sand-stone, loamy soils, rich Planting AMMI Large plant with nutrients (ammi majus) is an herbaceous plant of the umbrella family, which can be either annual or two -year -old. The birthplace of this plant is the Mediterranean countries, but it can also often be found in the territories of the Middle, Middle East, Western, Southern Europe and north of Africa. The botanical description does not differ in a rare shape of flowers or brightness. Amma large has the form 120 cm. The leaves of this plant of lanceolate, have a resemblance to the twigs of dill. The stem is hollow, branched. The root is rod.\n\nThe flowering period begins in May, when the bushes are covered with many small flowers of white color collected in magnificent inflorescences (diameter is from 10 to 25 cm). Up to 4000 flowers can bloom on one bush. Flowering on average continues until the beginning of autumn, after which fruits appear on the plant. They have a smooth surface, not covered with anything On top, on the sides are slightly flattened. The fruits are small, their size does not exceed 2.5 mm. Their ripening period begins in mid -autumn. Ammass is a large type of AMMI genus. Those who plan to plant this plant in their areas should familiarize themselves with the features of the popular varieties themselves, among which the Silver Tenter deserves special attention. The plant grows in the form of a spreading one -year -old shrub, covered with many stems, curling in the upper part. Plant height It does not exceed 1 m. The inflorescences are represented by large umbrellas with a diameter of 15 cm. This variety is characterized by a rather long vegetation period. Inflorescences retain their decorativeness even upon completion of flowering. Ammass is largely successfully grown as a cultivated plant, characterized by unpretentiousness in care. For this plant, only the presence of chernozem and the absence of weeds on the site are important. Ammassia can be planted in areas where vegetables, medicinal plants or were previously grown. Grain crops. In order for AMMI to greatly pleases with its magnificent flowering, it is recommended to grow it in areas well -illuminated by the sun (partial shade is allowed). The plant shows maximum decorativeness on nutritious, slightly acidic, loose soils. Amma large is propagated by seeds that must be sown in previously prepared areas (the soil is cleaned of the remnants of previous crops, dug, cultivated and harrowing). To achieve maximum decorativeness Plants many flower growers additionally introduce fertilizers into the soil.\n\nAmma large is sown both in the spring and in late autumn (in the winter), while the first option is considered more preferable, as it provides the best shoots. Before sowing, the plants need to be stratified for 90 days, after which the seed is recommended to dry and sift. Before direct landing, the seeds are kept in the water for 24 hours, those that surfaced to the surface are considered unsuitable for to behead."

This species is represented by annual and perennial plants, shrubs, less often - low trees. Prolonged flowering and decorativeness of leaves guarantees the love of flower growers around the world. In the natural conditions, the akalif can achieve the size of a huge shrub that affects its abundant flowering. In the apartment, its height hardly reaches 30-60 cm. Flowering with lush red “tails” is the main feature of this plant. Fluffy inflorescences of an elongated spike -shaped shape have the property of hanging down, so many flower growers prefer to grow acalifa not as a compact bush, but as an ampelous plant for decorating window openings and window sills. The EUFORBY or Molochaev family has more than 400 varieties that have related signs. There are flowering and decorative species with original carved leaves. Like all milkpaper, Akalifa is poisonous, with a cut, the plant expires with bitter milky juice. U Some representatives of the type of juice are medicinal that helps with lung diseases: pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma. In the southern countries, Akalifa is used as tonic tea in the breakdown of strength and/or weak intestines. During transplanting or trimming milk, you should not refuse rubber gloves in order to protect the skin. Like any indoor plant, Akalifa requires the creation of favorable conditions for growth and flowering. Competent care guarantees decorativeness and growth of a flower, Saturation of leaves, constant formation of ovaries and prolonged flowering. Caring for tropical plants at home is mainly in maintaining a comfortable thermal regime, sufficient watering without possible drying out of an earthen substrate, and creating humidity. Typically, in winter in apartments with central heating, many plants experience certain difficulties, so it will be required: frequent spraying with warm water of the foliage of the plant; a bowl of water located Next to the flowering acalifa; wet moss placed in a pot with a flower will help maintain sufficient humidity; placing a flower pot in a wide tray with wet expanded clay or pebbles - when the contents of the pallet, air humidity around the flower rises. Getting the landing material of the chic “fox tail” is quite simple. For this, the lignified aploom of the plant is suitable. Do not use side or young shoots. Most likely in a wet The environment will quickly die. You can root processes at any time of the year, but the rooting will occur faster in the spring months. The escape is either put in water for rooting, or immediately planted in the ground. They take equal proportions of sod land and sand for planting in order to make the substrate nutritious and light. A necessary condition for rooting the seedling is: the moisture content of the earthen coma, sufficient lighting, the right temperature regime. Proper plant care is the key to health And an attractive appearance. Subject to all agrotechnical subtleties, the plant develops well, has a thick foliage of saturated color, prolonged flowering. The yielding drying leaves warn that the plant experiences moisture deficiency. It is necessary to change the water regime, regularly water and spray abundantly. The grooves of the leaves become brown, dry and break off, the leaves are bought up. The reasons for such changes: lack of minerals in the soil, excess or lack of water. Try to transplant the plant, pay more attention to it, do not forget to water and spray. The tanning thin shoots, the poor development of the plant, the complete absence of flowering signal the acute lack of light. The change of space for more sunny or ensuring additional lighting with special phytolamps will help. The leaves of the leaves occur in dry air in the midst of the heating season. Air moisturizing measures will help prevent leaf fall. Perhaps simple Spraying the akalifs will not be enough, so it is necessary to use a set of measures: a bowl with water, a pallet with wet expanded clay, a humidifier of air. The growth does not develop and does not bloom, although it looks healthy outwardly - perhaps there is not enough nutrients. The nitrogen, which is part of all fertilizers for indoor colors, mobilizes the forces of the plant. In general, timely top dressing guarantee the development of a plant with a strong immune system, which itself copes with the external malicious environment."

This kind has over 100 varieties of plants, many of which are widely used in decorative gardening.\n\nMost representatives of this kind are strong -wide plants that form beautiful Compact bushes. Their height depends on the species features and can vary from 25 to 80 cm. Some varieties can reach a height of 100 cm or more.\n\nThe development of the shoots of the water collection is carried out for 2 years. In the first year, a renewal kidney is formed in the basal zone, from which a socket of young leaves, shoots and color -bearing shooters is subsequently formed. The rosette leaves are dark green, three-sided-dissected, petiole. The stem leaves are simple, sessile, Small. The genus of the water collection includes more than 100 species of plants found in the wild. Many wild varieties are actively used by breeders to obtain new original varieties. Consider a description of the types and varieties of Aquilegia. Aquilegia prefers to grow in slightly shaded places with moderately moist, loose and fertile soil. It is also allowed to grow it in sunny areas, but in this case the flowers of the plant will be less bright. Aquilegia is a perennial An unpretentious culture with a rather powerful and well -developed root system. This feature allows the plant to endure the drought. At the same time, this structure of the roots determines the painful reaction of the Aquilegia to the transplant.\n\nThe main care of the water collection provides for periodic watering, trimming, removing dried inflorescences and stems, episodic top dressing. These unpretentious perennials do not require specific care and special growing conditions. Water the water bribe Merely necessity. In dry summer, these plants are recommended to water 1-2 times a week. To propagate Aquilegia, flower growers use:\n\n\n\tseeds;\n\tcuttings;\n\tparts of the bush (Delenges). The most common disease of the seats is the powdery mildew, which appears in violations of the irrigation regime and soil swamping. The presence of this problem is usually indicated by the appearance of gray-yellow, dirty gray spots and light gray raid on the leaves. The fight against the disease involves a thorough Plant treatment with fungicidal agents (\"Fundazole\", \"topaz\"). Landscaping designers use various varieties and types of aquilegia when creating single and group landings, in the arrangement of multi -tiered flower beds and flower beds. These plants are able to organically fit into both the landscape and regular style of the garden.\n\nAquilegies of stunted varieties are ideal for decorating rocks. Here they will look successfully surrounded by turquoise bitterness, golden yellow and purple-pink stone. Tall varieties of a water column can be used in the design of rabbits and mixborders.

Its color palette consists of purple, pink, red and snow -white colors. A feature of the plant is its strong branchiness, but the size of the bush is quite compact-20-40 cm in diameter. There are annual and perennial species of these plants, but more often the culture is grown as an annual.\n\nThe foliage of this ground cover bush has an oblong shape. Flowering begins in May and continues until late autumn. Fragrant flowers are assembled in cystic inflorescences. In nature, about two hundred species of this kind are known. Alissum can have another name - a drill. But the name is a lawn lobby or lobulary, which can also often be heard in a conversation with a novice summer resident, are erroneous. Lobulary is considered a close relative to the genus Burachk, but these two words are not synonymous.\n\nBoth crops are combined into one family and Initially belonged to one genus, but over time, botanists revealed the difference in the description, structure and specifics of the development of two plants, and classified them into two kinds. Therefore, the equal sign between Alissum and Lobularia, often indicated on the packaging with seeds, is incorrect from a botanical point of view. However, the rules for growing these two cultures are quite similar. Varieties of culture can differ in the duration of flowering, sizes, shades. Work to remove new types And the varieties continue. The most in demand are currently the following types of presented culture.\n\n\n\t\n\tRocky. The stem reaches a height of 30 cm, the color of the foliage is preserved even in winter. The flowers are represented in a panicem form, but flowering does not last long, although it begins quite early. Of particular popularity in the circles of gardeners is the low-growing COMPACTUM variety, medium-sized Plenum with yellow flowers, casting gold, yellow-brown variety Dudley Neville, strongly The branching variety \"Golden plane\". Before proceeding with the sowing of culture in open ground, pay attention to the condition of the soil. Alissum prefers to grow in well -drained alkaline or neutral land. If these are rocky varieties, then they do not present special requirements for soil, but more comfortably they will feel in rocky or clay soil. Fertilizer does not need fertilizer, but liming is required.\n\nAll varieties, especially sea and rocky, are photophilous, and therefore Choose open sunny spaces for their planting. A favorable time for landing is May-June, at this time the upper layers of the soil are already well warmed up. With earlier sowing there is no guarantee that night frosts will not return, and if this happens, then they will negatively affect the condition of the plant.\n\nSome summer residents sow seeds in November for the experiment - with such a planting seed, the natural stage of stratification passes, and therefore strong and healthy are cursed in the spring Ships. Water the plant should be regularly, but moderate. The stagnation of moisture will provoke the development of root rot, especially the rocky varieties are very vulnerable to this process. To avoid such consequences, it is enough just to evenly moisten the flowerbed. This can be achieved if you water the ridge from the hose or by sprinkling. Some gardeners place the hose into the carpet so that the water is evenly distributed on the ground. At the end of September or early October, you need to start collecting sowing material. The procedure is carried out in dry calm weather. Spread the tissue material on the ground, take the inflorescences and grind them with your fingers. Now remove all the excess garbage from the fabric.\n\nPlace the collected seeds in a fabric bag and take into a dry well -ventilated room without drafts. Thus, planting material is stored until spring. The collection of seeds and sowing in open ground was already mentioned above. In the same paragraph, we consider the possibilities of growing seeds on seedlings of the house. This The procedure is suitable for summer residents who want to observe earlier flowering of culture, as well as when maintaining a flower in regions with a warm climate. You should know that growing seedlings is a more time -consuming process. The optimal time for this is the end of February - the beginning of March.\n\nBefore sowing, it is important to carefully prepare the soil. It should be a loose, nutritious, wet substrate. The process looks like this:\n\n\n\t\n\tFill the container prepared soil;\n\t\n\t\n\tPour the seeds into the ground and press slightly hand;\n\t\n\t\n\tPour the place of landing;\n\t\n\t\n\tCover the container with a transparent film to create greenhouse conditions;\n\t\n\t\n\tPut the container in a bright and warm place. One of the main enemies of this representative of the flora is a cruciferous flea-a small bug in a size of 2-3 mm, which feeds on leaves and is able to destroy the culture in 3-4 days on hot days. If this pest attacked the plant, then the processing of vinegar essence will help to cope with it. However, if a young copy is affected, then It is unlikely that he will withstand such a cardinal method of struggle, so the method is applicable only to strong adult bushes.\n\nOften, culture is struck by caterpillars. In this case, an infusion of tobacco with soap or a pharmacy chamomile will help. Often you can find whites and cabbage mol, with which Lepidocide and Antobacterin means effectively fight. The plant is used both for single and collective landing. It looks beautiful in flowerpots and kashpo, for example, when designing a garden in Italian style. A picturesque landscape can be created by planting a culture next to ground cover plants, with perennials and summer, for example, heliotrope, Turkish cloves, pelargonia. In the content of alissum, flower growers are attracted by its decorativeness and a pleasant smell that spreads to the entire garden. Like owners of flowers and the opportunity to make the most unusual compositions with it. According to summer residents, various varieties bloom quite well and magnificently, especially with abundant watering. I also like the fact that Alissum is growing very quickly, as well as the excellent ripening of its seeds. Lovers of these flowers often share with each other sowing material.\n\nThe disadvantages of growing Alissum are also noted. So, some gardeners, even experienced, try to grow a flower by sowing in open ground, but for several years this does not come out. In their opinion, the seeds do not have good germination. Other owners explain this phenomenon with strong heat or heavy soil and recommend that you try Planting with a seedling method, observing the two main conditions - the loose soil and timely watering.|||Lobularia Maritima, Primorskaya Lobulia, sea lobulary, coastal cooler, seaside perennial, annual, mainly as a curb plant, on rocky slides, for landscaping balconies, edging of flower beds and a slave, a pretty herbaceous plant, often branched at the base, low -growing up to 30 bushes Line-lanceolate 2-4 cm green no booby small about 50 white white strong honey, sweet June, July, August, September, October, November, December prolonged In the soil, you can sow both in the spring and in November (in November, as late or at the end of April or early May) the distance between plants: 15-20 cm blooms better in the sunny soil, the open soil is not demanding in the dry summer stops to bloom (it is required to water) the faded inflorescences can be extended for 1.5-2 months by the high-lobede-sprinkled lobular. Early and crops must be protected from frost with non -woven materials or greenhouse over the bed is unpretentious in The care of the alissum of the sea is a herbaceous plant for open ground, which belongs to the cabbage family. In specialized literature, one can also find other names of this plant - the Lobulia of Primorskaya or Marine, a stove -up and a drill. The birthplace of this species are the rocky shows of the mountains and rocky plains in the territory of Southern Europe. Allisum refers to ground cover species that have a compact, dense and very sprawling crown. The maximum height of an adult plant is not It exceeds 35 cm. Small oblong and pointed leaf plates are located on curly flowering shoots.\n\nInflorescences consist of small colors that have a wide color range. A distinctive feature of this flower is the presence of a pleasant honey aroma that intensifies in the evening hours. The beginning of flowering falls in the middle of autumn and continues until the end of September. Thanks to the long and painstaking work of breeders and botanists, gardeners can admire various varieties Alissum of the sea. Florists recommend paying attention to its varieties.\n\n\n\t Tim Tim is a plant whose inflorescences are painted in snow -white. This species refers to creeping flowers, the height of which does not exceed 10 cm, and its appearance resembles a sea wave foam.\n\t Violet Koning is an incredibly beautiful variety that belongs to ampelous species and is grown in suspended pots.\n\t The Purple Princess is an ampel form that forms long shoots. This flower can Grow both in the suspended pot and directly on the flowerbed. In order for a fragrant flower to appear on the site, the following reproduction methods can be used:\n\n\n\tcuttings;\n\tdivision of the bush;\n\tseminal;\n\tWith the help of seedlings.\n\n\nThe first two landing methods are characterized by the complexity of the process and complexity. To obtain processes from cuttings, it is necessary to cut the required number of cuttings in the middle of summer and root them in wet and nutritious soil, creating a film around the plantations shelter. After the appearance of new leaf plates, young plants can be transplanted to a permanent place of growth. Alissum marine is an unpretentious and frost -resistant plant, the cultivation of which will not cause difficulties even among novice gardeners. Despite these characteristics, experienced gardeners recommend paying attention to a number of features for growing and caring for a flower.\n\nIn order for the plant to be pleased with abundant and colorful flowering, it must be planted in sunny areas that Practically not in the shade. The soil on the flowerbed should not be acidified. It is better to use special mineral fertilizers as top dressing, but making a large amount of manure is better to avoid. This top dressing will provoke a quick set of green mass, which will interfere with the formation of inflorescences. Fertilizers must only be made in early spring. Despite the unpretentiousness and resistance to various diseases, a cruciferous flea can spoil the appearance of green spaces, which can be scared away by the infusion of garlic, wormwood and tobacco dust. Only chemicals will help to get rid of mass accumulations of insects. Regular examination of plants will help to avoid the appearance of caterpillars, whites and cabbage moths.\n\nOften thickened plantations suffer from powdery mildew, the first signs of which is a white plaque on the leaves. After some time, leaf plates become fragile, brittle and die. Before processing plants with special fungicides, it is necessary Be sure to remove all sick leaves and shoots.|||Alyssum Saxatile rocky perennial for rocky gardens, alpine slides and walls of dry masonry, as well as for borders, a slave and mixborders, a magnificent bush with a strong branchiness of a low-growing lignified, creeping lanceolate, small yellow June, July, July, August, August. September 40 days is plentiful and long-term beginning of April-May 40-50 cm the distance between the landings of sunny open soil any with prolonged drought 1-2 times a week every 2 weeks, Starting in June, dry inflorescences are cut off, sanitary seeds tolerates a decrease in temperature to -15 degrees requires loosening before irrigation, the homeland of the plant is unpretentious in departure -Central Europe and Small Asia. As a decorative perennial, Alissum began to be cultivated from the end of the 17th century. It is great for the creation of mountaineering and borders, including around lawns and garden paths.\n\nAlissum forms beautiful bushes of a hemispherical shape, the diameter of which usually does not exceed half a meter. Depending on the variety, the plant can reach a height of 30 cm. Its stems creeping, strongly branching, thickened and solid at the base. There are few leaves, they are grayish, pubescent and elongated. Flowers are bright, yellow, collected in magnificent inflorescences, exuding a strong aroma that attracts butterflies and bees. Alissum varieties are known. The most common of them are “gold plaster”, “golden wave” and yellow. Below is their brief description.\n\n\n\tGolden plane variety is enough He established himself well: unpretentious, cold -resistant, does not require frequent watering, it develops best in the sun. True, it blooms in the second year. Flowering lasts from the end of spring and the entire first month of summer. Timely and correct pruning of the bush can provoke a second wave of flowering, which occurs closer to the fall. In areas with a cool climate to cultivate Alissum is better than a seedling way. In the southern regions, you can sow seeds in the ground after snow mating and warming up site.\n\nAlissum seeds, which are distinguished by good germination, are sown for seedlings in March or April. To do this, a layer of drainage mixture is laid out on the bottom of a special box, then the soil is poured, which is a mixture of turf ground, humus and sand. It is better to spill the prepared land with fungicide in order to further avoid the appearance of a “black leg”.\n\nSeeds are laid out at a distance of 1-1.5 cm. Then they are watered with warm water and placed under glass or film. Grow alissum not a rocky It will be difficult-even a novice amateur gardener will successfully cope with this task. After all, this \"sunny\" flower can grow in one place without a transplant for several years, while almost without requiring care. But in order to create a spectacular flowerbed, which will deliver eyes throughout the summer, it is necessary to observe some cultivation rules. The plant is propagated by seeds, dividing the bush and cuttings. Seeds can be sown on seedlings or directly in open ground when it is in sufficiently warm up. For germination, the seeds need sunlight, so they are scattered on the surface of the earth and slightly crushed with their hands. The place of sowing for several days can be covered with plastic film. The emerging seedlings are weeded, removing extra plants and leaving a distance of 10 cm between them.\n\nIn the summer, Alissum can be propagated by a vegetative way. To do this, the cut shoots are rooted in fertile soil. It is preferable to plant cuttings in a greenhouse where they They will be protected against drafts and cooling. Alissum rocky is a favorite treat of a cruciferous flea, which is able to destroy all its foliage. Such chemicals as Intavir, Aktara, Borea, Tsunami and others will help get rid of the pest. Folk methods of struggle are also quite effective: planting treat wood, infusion or dry dust of tobacco. Wherever Alissum grows up, he seeks to capture as much space as possible, forming large Bushes. Thanks to this property, the ground cover plant quickly drains the cracks between the stones on the alpine hill, various pits and grooves.|||Annaporemist to framing flower beds, balcony boxes, on rocky slides, rockers, for planting between paths of paths forms a dense, creeping carpet of a low -growing bush, small lanceolate small, honey lanceolate from June until autumn and seedlings - July, May, September - August, April, July, July, July, July, July, July, July, June, June, June, June.

A characteristic feature of the plant is its unpretentiousness and ease of care. In the vast majority of cases, Alissum flowers have a white color. But there are also pink, yellow and purple varieties. There is another subtlety: the often found that Alissum and Lobulia is one and the same, obviously wrong.\n\nIn -depth A botanical study showed that these are different types, and the external similarity between them is largely by chance. However, for everyday cultivation, this difference does not play a special role. It is curious that the closest to Alissum is garden cabbage. At the same time, the flower cannot boast of culinary qualities and is used only for design purposes. It is not necessary to take seeds for landing in the store at all. \"Snow Carpet\" allows you to collect planting material in each season on Next year. Varietal characteristics will persist for a long time. Nevertheless, every 5 or 6 years it is better to change the culture (to conduct crop rotation), combining this with the update of planting material. This is the only way to save flowers from degradation.\n\nThe seeds will have to be collected at a strictly defined time. Important: they must be removed even if they do not use this material. Otherwise, Alissum will multiply randomly, by self -sowing. The collection time comes in September. Put it off on October and further inappropriate. The departure when growing alissum from seedlings does not differ from the same procedure when breeding it with seeds. Be sure to irrigate the earth and feed it. Removing a protective net is advisable when the plant rises to 0.05-0.07 m. A systematic thinning plays a very important role, without which the flowerbed cannot be formed correctly. Alissum is extremely poorly tolerates drought. During the heat, the lack of water often leads to the discharge of both flowering flowers and buds. But excessive irrigation is also not recommended, since stagnation of water is very harmful. Abundant watering is carried out only when they are sure of the high permeability of the soil. The frequency of watering is selected, given the state of the earth.\n\nWater needs a “snow carpet” when the soil has dried by 0.03-0.05 m deep. Usually this situation arises every 4 or 5 days. You can water the plant only with warm stained water. If there is no urgent need, water Alissum in the evening. WHITE AND WHICH DAIRS Earth by 0.05 m and mulch it. Adult alissum is not recommended to feed with organic matter. The optimal choice is complex mineral compositions, the same as for seedlings. Fertening is laid 4 times during the flowering season. The first top dressing is dedicated to its beginning. The alissum will have to be cut regularly, otherwise it will not form new inflorescences. At the same time get rid of dry sick shoots. The reaction to their removal is found very quickly. Only a few days will have to wait the formation of new shoots and flower buds. You can help the flower as much as possible by combining pruning and top dressing. Alissum is almost never sick. It contains a significant amount of alkaloids and flavonoids that suppress pathological organisms. However, the danger is fungal lesions. A special risk is associated with infection of late blight. The use of drugs containing copper helps to fight it.\n\nFrom marty dew helps spraying a one percent burgundy mixture. The cruciferous flea and the Belyanka are the main pests of Alissum. They fight them, spraying the plant with a mixture:\n\n\n\tdiluted vinegar in water;\n\tdaisy infusion;\n\ta certain amount of soap. Alissum \"Snow Carpet\" is a frequent guest on a flowerbed of a summer cottage or near the house. Features of the development of the plant allow you to use it in the format of the soliter. Then you will have to design a “spot” at least 0.5 m diameter."

Next, the most remarkable varieties of this succulent plant, conditionally divided into therapeutic and decorative ones, will be considered. The main criterion that determines the choice of a variety of aloe is the preferences of its owner (namely, in which he is going to use the acquired succulent - therapeutic or decorative).

Compliance with the latter allows you to grow a beautiful and healthy succulent that can delight its owner 5, 10 and even 20 years, depending on the characteristics of the selected variety. The optimal method of propagation of aloe is vegetative.

The plant has other names, this is a healing plant, Indian, Barbados, real aloe, lance, barbensis. His homeland is considered to be central Africa, although now it is growing in different countries of the world. Today it is considered to be an indoor plant, although it is cultivated as street. Aloe Vera is a therapeutic plant that can survive in adverse conditions. It is attributed to the category of succulents, the family Asphelovs. The difference between this species is the weak development of the root system. The aboveground part consists of long leaves with a prickly edge on both sides of each sheet.\n\nThe shape of the leaves is elongated and more like thick curved stems. At the same time, each sheet, which is distinguished by a dark green tint, is saturated with juice, which makes it fleshy. The juice of the plant has a gel-like texture and a weak greenish-yellow color. The height of the peduncle can reach 70-80 cm. The reproduction of the flower must be proceeded in The very beginning of spring. It is during this period that the plant begins to move away from winter sleep. Therefore, the processes of vital activity that have a beneficial effect on the development of the roots begin to be activated in it. Right now, it is ready to adapt to new conditions.\n\nTo plant a plant, select a container. The plant is unpretentious to the container, but it is preferable to choose a ceramic pot for growing succulent. The clay analogue is not suitable, since such a product will absorb all moisture from the soil in myself. When the container is prepared, a high layer of drainage is poured into it. It is necessary in order to exclude moisture stagnation. Despite the fact that the plant is considered unpretentious to care, you can note several recommendations. This will simplify the cultivation of succulent at home and will allow you to grow a healthy plant.\n\n\n\tFor the correct development and growth of aloe vera, sunlight is necessary, and therefore a pot with a flower after the appearance of seedlings must be put in a sunny place.\n\tIN The summer period of the pot should be taken out into the street, allowing the succulent to be sprinkled with fresh air.\n\tIf aloe is grown in indoor conditions, it is necessary to provide it with the temperature regime with the most favorable conditions for development, which is achieved at a temperature of + 22 ... + 25 degrees.\n\tThe minimum temperature mark, at which the plant will grow in winter, is at least +12 degrees.\n\tWatering the plants in the summer should be associated with spraying so that the flower is enough moisture.\n\tWater aloe Faith in winter needs to be dosed, and the volume of moisture should be smaller in comparison with summer watering.\n\tWe must not forget about the fertilizers of the mineral and organic type. Top dressing must be performed no more than once a month in summer.\n\tThe succulent grown at home in the winter period of the year must be protected from cold weather. You can not open the window on the windowsill of which there is a flower. You can propagate aloe vera in different ways: cuttings, seeds, shoots, children. Consider the methods used by gardeners. Over time, the plant can become cramped in a pot. This can be one of the causes of his death, because over time, the end of nutrients will occur by the root system of the plant from the soil. And the matter will not even save the constant fertilizer: it will not be possible to avoid transplantation, because over time, the huminum and enzyme components will disappear from the soil, which will not be replenished in any way. The first signs of this will be the lightness of the soil and its covering the watering field with a crust.\n\nAs for Young plants, they need to transplant them every year, changing the soil. When Aloe Vera is 5 years old, the frequency can be reduced. Now it will be enough for him to change the soil and the container every 2-3 years. You need to make a transplant in the spring or summer season: this is the most successful time in which the plant will quickly root.\n\nFor a drainage layer, you can use river pebbles, small shells, as well as clay shards. According to the standards to the container, the new pot should be larger than the previous About a quarter. In the process of development and growth of aloe vera, the layman may encounter some problems. We note the main of them.\n\n\n\tIf in the process of growth in the plant the ends of the leaves become brown, this indicates insufficient humidity. In this case, you just need to ventilate the room where the flower grows.|||Alóe arboréscens, aloe Kranz, candelabric aloe Africa-South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Malavi Trivarine (Arbrestes) Therapeutic, High-Rine Cosmetology 200-300 80 Large, average 20-65 3-6 linear-linite meaty smooth, matte, matte linear.

The fact is that the first plant is a variety of the second. ALOE is a succulent evergreen culture. There are a huge number of varieties of this plant (more than 300). Each subspecies has its own Features that were the reason for the classification. The most famous for all are Aloe Vera and the hundred -year -old. It will be useful to figure out where the natural conditions are familiar to plants. Initially, cultures loved the South African climate for its high temperatures and dry air. In the wild Aloe Vera and a hundred can be found in deserts and semi-deserts, as well as in a tropical climatic belt. Due to its unpretentiousness and exceptional medical properties of Aloe, it quickly became Popular throughout the world. Now it can be found in almost every country. At the same time, the culture is perfectly adapted to completely different conditions. Many people confuse Aloe Vera and a hundred, believing that this is one and the same plant. But there are differences, although insignificant. The most explicit distinguishing feature of each variety is the appearance. The first plant has long pointed thick leaves that grow up from the root. The tabletop grows in the form of a tree having a trunk from which fleshy leaves with sharp ends diverge. The form and size of the leaves can also say a lot about the plant belonging to one or another type. In the centenary, they are smaller, thinner and already. Accordingly, the juice in such leaves contain much less. A common feature is the presence of both types of small needles along the edges of the leaves. And, of course, both crops have pronounced healing properties, which is why they gained such fame and popularity. The first application of aloe in Medical purposes are noted even in the time of ancient Egypt. The found documents mentions the juice of this plant as one of the ingredients of at least 10 balsamic recipes. And today, many varieties of aloe are often used in traditional medicine. Their healing properties of many save in the absence of medicines. The chemical composition of this plant is very rich. Culture contains a large number of various vitamins and minerals (potassium, magnesium, zinc, calcium, etc.). So, juice and The pulp of this “home assistant”: they contribute to rapid tissue regeneration for wounds and cuts; they are widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections (staphylococcal infections, infections of the gastrointestinal tract and others); effective for diseases associated with bronchi, as well as with conjunctivitis of the eye. A tabletop is most often used for external use. For example, the juice and pulp of this plant: soothe the skin with inflammatory processes (eczema, acne, allergic reactions, etc. d.); contribute to the stretching of pus during abscesses; accelerate the regeneration of the skin with burns; contribute to deep moisturizing the skin and increases its elasticity; reduce redness and itching in the case of bites of mosquitoes, OS, gadfly, ants, etc.; help the disappearance of scars and stretch marks. Any healing plant, in addition to healing properties, has contraindications. Aloe is no exception. The maintenance of tinctures, which include aloe, can contribute to the expansion of blood vessels. Therefore, this succulent is not People with reduced blood pressure should be used. For the same reason, this plant should be excluded by pregnant women, since imprudence in use can cause bleeding. For wounds and cuts, aloe juice should be used only after the wound itself is disinfected and washed from pus. Otherwise, this can lead to the development of the inflammatory process. There is no particular difference in the departure between Aloe Vera and the centenary. Both representatives of the flora are required The minimum amount of attention. The main thing is the presence of constant sunlight and regular irrigation. As a hundred -year -old and aloe is related to plants having a special layer for the supply of water (general name - succulents), they do not require frequent irrigation. In the winter, it is enough to apply moisture 1-2 times a month. In the summer, plants require watering with a frequency of 1-2 times a week. Water should not be on top of the leaves, but under the root. The amount of water should also not be large. You should wait for the liquid to absorb into the ground. If the plant is poured with water, it can begin to rot."

It was described and highlighted in a separate clan it was Swedish scientist Karl Linnie in the 18th century - before that, Amarillis was perceived as one of the varieties of lilies. Outwardly, Amarillis looks almost like hippeastrum. Often, even amateur flower growers confuse them, and in stores the second plant is often given out as the first, since it is more common. However, the similarity of the two colors is understandable, because they are closest relatives: they belong to the same genus of the Amarillisovs. Distinguishing features at “Brothers” are also enough, they are just not always obvious. Let us consider them. Rodina Amarillis is South Africa, while Hippoastrum is a native of South America. Therefore, the second flower gets used to the Russian climate faster, unlike the first, to which its origin in the country of the “eternal summer” makes it difficult to adapt to more severe conditions. Because of this, Amarillis is somewhat more picky for care and growing conditions than its relative. Until recently, it was believed that Amarillis is only one species - Belladonna. This is a plant with pale pink or pale lilac colors, similar to the bell. It is not so difficult to provide Amarillis with the suitable conditions of detention. However, it should be remembered that he has a phase of vegetation and a phase of peace. And during these periods, the requirements for the place of placement, lighting and temperature, as well as watering and top dressing will differ significantly. It is very important to choose the right pot for planting. Better give preference to heavy Options made of ceramics or clay are more stable, so they are more suitable for the high and thick stem of Amarillis, reducing the risk of flowering the flower along with the capacity. Plant care at home is easy to carry out. During the rest, nothing needs to be done. Only when Amarillis enters the flowering phase, it requires regular watering and periodic top dressing to form buds and flowers blossomed. At the junction of summer and autumn, large Beautiful flowers that last up to 25 days. However, the plant can be forced to bloom at a certain time, if you transplant the bulb 2 months before the desired duration of the appearance of buds.

The Titanic species is considered the largest and most high, which can be judged by the size of a tuber, which sometimes weigns about 20 kg. The cobber of such a flower is approximately 2 m in Height, it is surrounded by a fleshy inflorescence of burgundy color. This is one of the most popular species among flower growers, but growing it at home will not work due to size. Propagate the flower with tubers, children and pollination. The last method is bad in that it is not so simple to make it, because female and male flowers do not bloom at the same time. That is why the plant lures insects, holding them with pollen until the time until men's flowers open. If you still pollinate the flower, the seeds will be formed with the simultaneous death of the mother plant. Insects fly to a flower attracted by the aroma, although they do not lay down the larvae on it. As for the reproduction by children, then the amorphophalus is overgrown with them after it bakes and forms. Their size usually does not exceed 2 cm, although it can vary depending on the specific type. Despite the fact that there is always a lot of children in the flower, you can divide the tuber. This method is considered effective in the propagation of a snake tree. To grow amorphopallus on your own at home, you need to know the basic conditions of its comfortable growth and development. For example, a capacity for him needs deep and large, but necessarily with straight sides. This is necessary to ensure a good drain and exclude stagnation of water in the ground. If you provide the plant with the right conditions for growth and development, it will be possible to notice its rapid growth. Help for amorphophalus should be fertile, but loose in order to exclude stagnation of water. Substrate It is prepared from garden soil and sand in proportions of 4: 1. In order to doubt the quality and correctness of the soil, you can purchase it in a specialized store by asking the seller for indoor flowers related to the aroid family. It cannot be unequivocally said that the amorphophalus is unpretentious in care, because it reacts to climate changes and the degree of illumination, like other plants. Healthy leaves live for no more than six months, appearing after flowering and yellow in mid -October. Every The sheet grows above the previous one, becoming more dissected. In order for the plant to feel comfortable, the pot must be placed at the window overlooking the southern side. Additional top dressing will help to avoid excessive exhaustion of the bulb. Sometimes tubers are stored in winter without a substrate. Bulbs are removed from the soil when the leaves dry, giving all the juices tuber. This is a suitable time for separation of subsidiaries, as well as the removal of rotten areas. If there is no crushed charcoal, with Its processing can be replaced with a solution of potassium permanganate. After that, the tuber is placed in a prepared box made of wood or cardboard and removed for storage in a dark and cool place. Plant it in the spring according to the standard scheme."

The inflorescences of the plant are painted in a crimson, pink, snow -white or red shades.\n\nSome shrubs are covered with colorful leaves, and white stripes are found on the petals of other flowers.\n\n\n\tThe variety of Rosea Flora captivity with terry inflorescences of dark pink color is widely popular. Rounded bright red fruits appear on a tree with a spreading crown. Flowering of the variety begins in June.\n\tOften used in landscaping and a single -phase hawthorn \"Stickta.\" This variety is characterized by the presence of a crown with branches looking upward. In height, the tree grows to 6-8 meters. The shape of its leaves resembles maple.\n\tIn the hawthorn of Pendul, weeping branches grow, sometimes even with a yellow bark.\n\t \"Alba Plena\" grows into a spherical shrub with a height of 2.5 to 3 meters. It is covered with long burgundy spikes and white terry flowers. The color of the leathery sheet plates changes from dark green to yellow-orange.\n\tHawthorn \"Rubble Captivity ”can take the shape of both shrubs and a small tree. The dense crown is abundantly covered with ruby ​​inflorescences and tough light green leaves.\n\tThe \"compact\" variety refers to dwarf spherical shrubs growing to no more than 3 meters. Its flowering lasts from May to June and is accompanied by the appearance of snow -white flowers. The landing of the hawthorn of a single -playing hawthorn to the site is organized in the fall or spring. If the plant is at the age of 2 years, then it is better to transfer it On open ground in the spring, so that it manages to take root reliably before wintering. This should be done only when the soil temperature warms up to +4-5 degrees. For specimens over 5 years, the time is more suitable: the next spring the young bush will bloom and even delights with a small amount of fruits. It is important to meet the first September decade so that at least 1.5 months remain until frost. The exact dates are determined depending on the climatic features of the region.\n\nFor однопестичного боярышника рекомендован открытый и хорошо проветриваемый участок, но с рассеянным светом. Даже частичное затенение способно навредить культуре: растение будет меньше плодоносить, да и в целом выглядеть хуже. Грунт подойдет любой, но обязательно дренированный. Развиваться на заболоченной местности растение не в состоянии. Оптимальная кислотность составляет 7,5-8 pH. Бедные земли обязательно обогащаются перегноем и древесной золой. Неприхотливый боярышник однопестичный требует Only the most basic departure. It is possible to properly propagate the hawthorn by a single -pharyngeal man with cuttings, layering, offspring and seeds.\n\n\n\tFor cuttings, it is required to take young twigs, in which about half the stem has already become obsessed. The blanks are cut at an angle of 45 degrees using an acute instrument that is disinfected by alcohol. The branches are immersed in moisturized land and are watered until sprouts arise on them. Further, the hawthorn can be transferred to constant The habitat where he has to grow and take root.\n\tPropagation with layering is easiest: the branch leans to the soil, fixed with a special bracket and sprinkled with earth. When the process is rooted, it remains only to separate from the mother’s plant and transplant to another place.\n\tSuitable for the purpose of propagation and offspring growing on the root.\n\tFinally, the seeds are proposed to use. The material that has passed 12-month stratification is distributed by grooves whose depth It does not exceed 1.5 cm. Crops are covered with dry foliage, coniferous branches or protective canvas. The hawthorn of a single -knee usually does not feel bad in cases where it grows in the shade, has long been in high humidity or at low temperature. Probably infection of culture and powdery mildew, from which the crown suffers most strongly.\n\nIn this case, the affected parts will have to be cut immediately, and the plant itself is sprayed with copper sulfate or “purely flowing”. In order not to attract pests, Shrubs are prophylactically treated with copper -containing drugs. From apple aphids, the plant “Iskra” helps the plant, and the “Dursban” from the leaflet. Hawthorn can be grown alone or be part of group compositions. An unpretentious plant reacts perfectly to a haircut, and therefore it manages to give any shape. Often, culture is used for the design of hedges, park edges or recreational zones. With the help of a shrub, you can also arrange necessary accents on the lawn.|||Crataegus Persimilis, Crataegus Prunifolia North-Western part of North America is a single-phase decorative, suitable for hedges in private gardens and urban landscaping, for cutting forms of decorative, is used in landscaping the type of hawthorn medium-sized wood, bushes 5-7 balloon, bouncer. conical, symmetric directed upward, densely branched dull gray to 4-8 narrow, backward, broad-elliptical, rhomboid-elliptical from above Brilliant, naked, below lighter, naked or with pubescence along the main vein up to 4 shields 8-18 1.2-1.7 May average about 1 bright red red September, October is photophilous, a little shading is fresh and humid, drained, quite fertile tolerates well and gas resistant, wind resistant, good high 5 (from a good high (from -29 ° to -23 °) Cliped hawthorn is a hybrid that can have the appearance of both a tree and a bush. With proper care, the plant can reach a height of 7 m, There is an asymmetric crown in a tree, the diameter of which is often about 5 m. When obtaining a sufficient amount of natural sunlight and moisture, an annual increase can be about 25 cm. Hairy -cheap is characterized by numerous shoots and a barrel on which there are small spines. The landing of the hawthorn is quite simple and does not cause any difficulties even among novice gardeners. Events are almost the same as when working with other shrubs or trees.\n\nYoung bushes It is necessary to plant in the beginning of spring until the leaves bloom. During the season, the plant will be able to take root, and also give the first increase. In addition, such shrubs do perfectly with winter, as they manage to get stronger to the first cold. Despite this, landing hawthorn is not prohibited in the fall, and the shrub is often planted even after the leaf fall.\n\nClose attention must be paid to the selection of the optimal place. It is best to choose areas that receive a sufficient amount of sunny Sveta. It is not recommended to plant hawthorn near the house or playing area, as flowering bushes smell quite unpleasant. Clivalist hawthorn can multiply in several ways. One of the most popular, but complex, is cuttings. The main problem is that planting material is quite difficult to root. Cuttings are best cut in early spring, until the kidneys begin to swell. In the role of planting material, green shoots are used, the thickness of which It is no more than 1 cm. It is best to choose shoots that grow from the south side.\n\nCut cuttings must first be sent to a root formation stimulator, so it will be possible to activate the growth process. The prepared material is laid in nutritious and light soil, after which it is cleaned in a place with a sufficient amount of natural light.\n\nFor germination, the cuttings need a constant level of humidity, so it will be necessary to water watering on a permanent basis and Spray plants. If the cuttings coped with the cold winter, then in the spring they should be fed with nitrogen. This hybrid is famous for its resistance to many diseases and pests. In this case, it is necessary to observe the rules for growing plants in order to prevent its defeat by various pests. Very often, the plant is affected by powdery mildew. This is a fungus that attacks young foliage and shoots, which can negate the crop and completely destroy the tree. The main danger of the fungus is that Without treatment, it grows extremely quickly and leads to deformation of shoots. In the process of treatment, it is necessary to get rid of the affected areas, as well as constantly spray the shrub with fungicides.\n\nOften the hawthorn affects the rust, which leads to the drying of the foliage. An excellent means of combating it is the use of Bordeaux fluid.\n\nAs for pests, the hawthorn is exposed to aphids. Due to its influence, it is very often covered with red growths, which leads to drying. Without treatment, not to cope here, and it is best to use for this special widespread fungicides."

Inflorescences resemble umbrellas, with a diameter they are 20 cm, pink or milk. The flowering begins in the third year in May and lasts all summer. Elder Undead to the light. It will take root anywhere: both in the shade and in the bright sun. Planting is recommended to be carried out in spring or autumn, before the onset of cold weather, so that the plant can adapt to winter. Choose a warm, calm day, preferably cloudy. To plant a young seedling in open ground, it is necessary to treat its growth in the place of growth in 2 years with an alkaline solution. If you did not have time to do this, then conduct the liming of the earth with dolomite flour. Podge the hole in the ground, About half a meter with diameter. Pour a bucket of humus, 50 g of phosphorus and the same amount of potassium fertilizer there. Mix all this with the ground and pour. Install the seedling in a wet hole so that the root neck remains after falling asleep on the surface, then carefully straighten the branches from the root and fill it with the ground. Pour water well and drive a fixing stake near the plant, then tamp the soil a little. This shrub is formed in the form of a multi -barrel bush. For this on it Leave from 10 to 20 branches of different ages. All berries grow on the shoots of last year. In the spring, it is necessary to reduce the upper shoots by one kidney, and the side-by 2-3. Old branches are cut so as to give the shrub a circular shape. In general, the shrub needs anti -aging pruning only every three years. Then the crown is completely cut off, almost under the root. You can leave approximately 10-15 cm. When preparing for winter, it is necessary to cut the crown of the bush by a third in September. Elder It is resistant to frosts, it tolerates the cold well (the winter hardiness zone is 4B), but still it is better to cover the shoots for the winter - it will protect the root system. However, it is worth noting that even if it freezes, it will quickly recover due to rapid growth. If autumn turned out to be dry, then after pruning, pour the plant well. In October, be sure to process a disinfectant. The soil is constantly loosening and mulch. If the plant grows on fertile land, then it is not necessary to fertilize in the winter. A In case of growing on poor soil, be sure to feed the culture with organic or mineral fertilizer. Propagation can be carried out in three ways. Despite the good survival of the plant, it can affect fungal and viral diseases, in addition, the shrub is subject to pest attack. In a drought, an elderberry can defeat a spider mite, a tail pile, an elderberry mining flush. In the spring, May Khrushch and Aphid attack her. The scoop damages the root system. For destruction Pests are used by the drug \"BIOTLIN\" and other insecticides. It is a resistant to the plant to diseases such as powdery mildew, fusariosis, anthracnosis. The leaves begin to fold from them, the fruits spoil, the barrel dies. For struggle and warning, solutions with fungicidal compounds are used. The whole crown of the plant is sprayed with them, the barrel is smeared. In addition, the barrel of the bush in October must be covered with a solution of lime. Prevention must be done all summer, every one and a half months. For This is suitable for an infusion of copper sulfate or burgundy liquid.

If there was little snow in winter, then the irrigation procedure is carried out immediately after it melted. Highly once a year, this representative of the flora needs fertilizer. In early spring, gardeners recommend feeding Weigel with a mineral mixture, including superphosphate, urea, potassium. During the formation of buds, potassium and double superphosphate are suitable as additional nutrition. Periodically, organic culture can be offered, it has a beneficial effect on The development of shrub. Western is sanitary pruning, removing dry, injured, frozen branches. To rejuvenate the bush, after flowering, cut the stems, the age of which exceeded 3 years. The formation of a crown with aesthetic purpose is also allowed. Before wintering, it is important to properly warm the plant. It is customary to bind the branches with a rope and bend to the ground, and be covered with dry foliage on top or cover with agriculture. Under the snow, the copy will not freeze and will feel quite comfortable, so You can sprinkle a shrub and snow in winter. In special insulation, the plant needs the first year of life. Immunity to diseases and insects in this variety is medium and largely depends on compliance with the rules of agricultural technology. So, overflow and high humidity contribute to the occurrence of putrefactive processes in the root system. The plant \"Topsin\" will help to save the plant. As a measure of prevention in the spring, culture can be treated with copper sulfate. If signs of rust appear on the shrub, then it is recommended Use Bordeaux liquid. The shrub can be diluted with generative and vegetative ways. When using the seed method, planting material retains signs of the parent plant 100%. Sowing is made in warm land in the spring, and the seedlings can be planted in a permanent place for the next spring. After 3 years, flowering can be observed. When designing a garden, landscape designers often use the presented variety.

This plant belongs to the Honeysunder family and is found in nature in the eastern and southeastern regions of Asia. The description of Bristol Ruby contains information that the height of the copies reaches 2.5 meters, and the width is sometimes 3 meters. Nevertheless, regular pruning and the formation of the crown can reduce the parameters to a meter height and the same width. In the year, the height of the Weigela increases up to 50 centimeters. The culture flowering in June or July pleases gardeners over two weeks to almost 30 days. The open buds, resembling bells with their appearance, form inflorescences of 3-6 pieces. In most cases, Ruby Bristol has re -flowering in The end of summer, but already in smaller volumes. Red Weigel changes its color from delicate raspberry to a bright shade of Rubin. At the end of the second stage of flowering, the place where the inflorescences were located is covered with boxes filled with seeds. It must be immediately mentioned that in the shade the plant blooms very small. Landing \"Bristol Ruby\" in open ground begins with the choice of the right place. It is recommended to carry out the procedure in the spring - from March to April, before flowering, or in emergency situations in the fall, but being ready for the fact that in winter seedlings can die. The site should be well lit and not allow the wind to harm the plant. In addition, it is important that from one to two free meters to be preserved between the bush and fence, wall of the house or other landings. Glubin of the formed hole is 50 centimeters, and the diameter reaches almost 70 centimeters. The soil should be light and fertile, with neutral acidity or slightly alkaline. The bottom is covered with drainage, combined from gravel, pieces of brick or expanded clay. Veigeli's care “Bristol Ruby” is relatively simple.

In the summer, the surface is loosened after each irrigation procedure or rain. Additionally, mulching occurs using peat. Most often, Weigel multiplies with cuttings, since this method is quite simple. Green branches are cut in early June, when the lending process has just begun. Gardeners recommend holding a length of 10 centimeters and Make sure that there are two leaves on each cuttings. All sheets break off, after which the resulting stalk is cleaned for 2-3 hours in water. It is not forbidden at this stage to use a small amount of stimulant for roots, for example, “heteroauxin”, taken in an amount of 150 milliliters per liter of ordinary water. It is better to hold soaked petioles in a darkened room, the temperature of which is approximately 20 degrees of heat. The next in a small container a mixture of turf is laid and humus. The stalk deepens about 2 centimeters, after which the entire surface of the earth is sprinkled with sand, ideally collected by the river. Additionally, Weigel is recommended to be covered with a regular glass to form the greenhouse effect. Cuttings are irrigated in the morning and evening every day, as well as once every 3 days they are treated with a weak solution of potassium permanganate. When the sprouts appear from the soil, the glass can be removed in the daytime. As soon as the length of the plant reaches 5 centimeters, you can transplant Its in a separate pot. Weigel of this variety has good resistance to most diseases. And the emerging diseases are quite quickly cured with the help of dissolved laundry soap, potassium permanganate or “carbofos”. In no less effective from improvised means, infusions of garlic or onions, crushed tobacco or wormwood are considered. A single percent solution of \"topsin\" allows you to cure Weigel from rust or decay. As a preventive measure, regular Removing the falling foliage. From the pests of the Weigel, Bristol Ruby most often attacks the aphids, which feeds on the juices of leaf plates and the buds themselves, and also covers the surface with sticky mucus. When this insect appears, it is necessary to use a mixture of laundry soap and potassium permanganate or “carbophos”. Of the folk remedies, tobacco, garlic or bitter pepper are most often used.|||Nana Variegata Blossoming is used to create small landscape groups, as a tapeworm; It is recommended for rocky gardens, to create picturesque borders and stunted hedges; It goes well with the flowering perennials, the composition of mixborders and a slave, a graceful wide-sized shrub is slow compact medium-sized up to 150 to 180 to 180, the openwork are located opposite elliptic, with a sawn edge, green with a yellow-white border, complex umbrellas 3-4 have a pronounced The pink color of the bell-shaped relatively small white-pink average spring, the autumn open, well-lit, well-lit, protected from the wind, the distance between the bushes 1.5-3 m grows well on loose and fresh, grows poorly on waterlogged soil from sour to slightly alkaline spring abundantly watered at drought or if the winter was snowless (8-10 liters per bush) In the early spring, mineral fertilizer is applied in the snow, the second top dressing in early June in the spring is removed annually by damaged The shoots, every 2-3 years, is pruning after flowering in the middle strip, the average 6 (from -23 ° to -18 °) does not tolerates excess moisturizing the early May -Juin, the plentiful Weigel is a representative of the Hospital family. His homeland is considered to be the Far East, Siberia, Sakhalin. In nature, this plant can most often be found on the edge of the cedar trees, on a rocky slope, as well as near the coast of a reservoir. It has 15 types and Hundreds of varieties, including Nana Variegata, are in particular demand. This is low (you can say dwarf), but a thick, rather sprawling leaf-fingered shrub with large pale pink colors, which was specifically bred in landscape design. The question of the propagation of Weigla Nana Variegata is very relevant. Many amateur crops, pursuing the goal of making a shrub with one of the elements of their green area, think about how to do it. Propagate The shrub can be two ways, which, of course, are familiar to everyone. The first option is to grow from the seeds. This method is used in most cases only professionals in special nurseries. This is due to the fact that it is quite difficult and requires certain knowledge and time. All you need to do is buy seeds and sow them in a container, without first processing. The container must be covered with glass on top so that something like a greenhouse and its inherent conditions form. The garden box is transplanted only when the height of the stems reached 7 centimeters. Only after 2 years, “Nana Variegat” is transplanted into open ground to a permanent habitat.

Soil preparation - the soil should be loose and rich humus. The level of acidity and alkalis should be minimal. Pits. It should not be small, because the root system will grow rapidly, and she should have enough space. The depth should be at least 65 centimeters. It is necessary to prepare a mixture that make up the sand, peat, soil and mineral fertilizers. Once the pits are filled with a layer of small gravel or crushed stone. Next, it is worth laying a layer of prepared drainage mixture and installed in the center. The sagger is filled with soil. Mulching and rammed.

All of the above is relevant only if there is no precipitation in the summer. If the summer is rainy, the plant is not at all It is necessary to water. Feeding. When withstanding all the rules for planting and using special mineral fertilizers, the next 3 years the bush does not need additional additives. If you really want to feed, then use organics. Upon reaching the age of 3, the shrub needs to be fertilized with superphosphates and organic additives. Switching and mulching. Young plants need to loosen and preferably after watering is carried out. Constant loosening will make it possible to saturate The root system of the plant with the required amount of oxygen. The first mulching is carried out immediately after planting in open ground. As mulch, wood wrap is used. The shrub is very beautiful in itself, its crown is spreading, it is not specifically formed. All that is necessary is to perform sanitary pruning with the advent of spring. You need to cut dry and dead shoots. After the second flowering, the bush can be rejuvenated. Winter. Winter hardiness is a line of Weigel \"Nana Variegata.\" But Despite this, it is impossible to leave the plant in the cold without protection.|||Nana Purpurea Blooming is used in solitary and group plantings, to create free-growing hedges, in slave and mixborders, a spectacular shrub grows slowly compact low-growing, rounded flexible, slender, strong, not bending short-term, 10-25 cm oval young Red-brown, during the season, a cylindrical panicle is green 3-4 bell-pink medium spring, autumn open, well-lit, protected from the wind The distance between plants of 1.5-3 m grows well on loose and fresh, it blooms poorly on waterlogged in the spring watered abundantly when dried or if the winter was snowless (8-10 liters under the bush) in early spring mineral fertilizer, the second top dressing in early June is removed annually by frost, and pruning 2-3 times a year after ending is carried out after the end of the end. The average 6 (from -23 ° to -18 °) unpretentious early June -July in nature needs flowering. In the Primorsky Territory of our country, in the north of China and in Japan. The presented variety is a small long-term shrub, the height of which is 70-150 cm. Under favorable conditions, the plant will be up to 2 m in size. The culture grows slowly, but it has a beautiful neat rounded crown. The annual increase is 15 cm. Libes are distinguished by an oval shape and short petioles, the color of foliage is purple, green over the season. Therefore, the plant has a decorative look in any The time of the year. Flowering is a dissolution of dark pink flower flowers with a yellow center. In length, the flowers reach 5 cm, in diameter-2-5 cm. One inflorescence has 3-5 flowers. Planting is carried out in the spring, when the soil is well warmed up. Most often this is April-May. A three -year -old copy is used as planting material. If the seedling is purchased in the fall, then it is buried in the ground in an inclined position, and sawdust, peat or humus are added on top. When choosing a place Give preference to sunny areas for planting, but it is possible to plant in partial shade, for example, under a rare crown of a tree. If the plant feels a deficiency of the sun, then it will lose its aesthetic coloring and form less inflorescences. The place next to the fence or building will be suitable, which will protect the young fragile seedling from the destructive gusts of wind. This variety does not make strict requirements, so as a substrate you can use a mixture of humus, sand and sod The lands in the ratio of 2: 2: 1. Caring for the plant is not so difficult, but it cannot be launched. The health of the seedling and the beauty of the garden area depend on competent care. Growing consists of the following stages. Watering the shrub needs in early spring after dry weather has become well. One copy must be provided with water in a volume of 8-10 liters. During the season, the plot is moistened as the soil dries. When watering, use water that is defended during the day. Propagate the presented The variety can be several methods."

One of the brightest representatives is F1 dark red.\n\tFlowering lasts all day, at night hibiscus Fucking.\n\tThe fruit formed after the flower falls contains brown seeds that smell of wood and wine.\n\tThe plant trunk has a direct shape, the bottom is woody with a dark brown bark. The flower is extremely strong and hardy. Despite the fact that the culture is quite thermophilic, it is not in mood. If you have acquired a plant in a specialized store, for about two weeks it needs to be left alone so that it adapts to new conditions. Only after this period can Start landing in prepared fertilized soil. Mineral top dressing must be carried out only during the formation of flowers. For these purposes, fertilizers of the mineral type are used, the presence of nitrogen in them is mandatory. In winter, mixtures with potassium and phosphorus are used (no more than once a month and in a half dose). Top dressing is carried out only after watering. Hibiscus loves moisture, especially in the warm season. Therefore, for spring summer and autumn there is a period of regular and abundant moisture. IN It is enough to water hibiscus once a week. Only defended water at room temperature is used. After the moisture procedure, it is necessary to save the pallet from excess moisture. This can be done half an hour after watering.\n\nWater procedures should not be limited to watering. It is necessary to carry out spraying, remove dust, wipe the foliage at equal intervals. In winter, you can simply clean the leaves with wet wipes. These manipulations help prevent attacks insects-pests. Since the plant comes from the tropics, it needs bright light, but it is better if the rays are not straight. Scattered lighting is preferable. Direct light can damage the foliage, burn it. Flowering of the plant begins in early spring. On the continuation of the summer and autumn periods, the shrub is decorated with bright beautiful inflorescences. Usually their diameter reaches 12-15 cm. If the flowering is smaller, then the culture is not enough light. The hibiscus propagates with seeds and cuttings. Last The method is most common. Before the start of spring, dry branches are cut off, placed in dishes with water or wet sand. After about two weeks (or earlier), rudiments of the roots appear. After that, the plant is planted in a separate container. In general, hibiscus is quite resistant to insect diseases and attacks, if the care is organized correctly. However, if something is overlooked, unpleasant situations are possible.\n\nIf hibiscus lacks the necessary trace elements or moisture, it will begin To throw foliage and inflorescences. If you notice such signs, replace the upper layer of soil or carry out the transfer of the plant to fresh soil, provide high -quality watering. If the foliage acquires a yellowish tint and falls off, check how high quality the water that you water the flower. Perhaps she is too chlorinated. Water should stand before watering at least a day."

The variety is white. Tall bushes reach 3 meters in height. The width of the crown varies from 3 to 5 meters. After planting, the plant develops rapidly, Actively growing. The crown has a spreading dome shape. She is able to grow into entire “islands.” The harsh are elastic, flexible. As they grow, they begin to lean towards the soil and are able to root in this way. In the spring, the branches are painted in olive-green color. With the advent of autumn, the bark changes the color to burgundy-red. Littleness-large, the surface is slightly wrinkled. The form is ovoid. The length of the plate grows up to 8 centimeters. Color is dark green in the center. Kaima is white. View - variegated. Deren Elegantissima has high decorative qualities. The root system is collected from a large number of small and thin roots. The size of the inflorescences is 10 centimeters. The form is umbrella. The color of flowers is white with a pink tint. The fruits grow small, spherical. The color of the fruit is white or gray with a blue tint. The fruits are inedible. Deren begins to bloom in May, and this period continues in June. The terms of flowering variety are medium. Sometimes a second wave of flowering is possible, which It comes from August to September. Pros: unpretentious care; the plant develops well in almost any ground; resistance to frost; rapid growth; bright color of the bark; high decorative properties. Minuses: the bush takes up a lot of space, since the shoots grow rapidly; so that the crown looks neat, you need to regularly perform pruning. The elegantissima is ideal for creating high hedges. With its help, you can disguise out household buildings and other facilities for land plot. Using trimming and haircuts, you can turn the bush into a real work of art, transforming it into a sculpture. Deren looks harmoniously next to various tall shrubs or trees. Planting can be carried out almost at any time of the year (in summer, spring or autumn). The choice of landing time depends on the propagation method. Fresh seeds are sown in the fall, and stratified material is used in the spring. And also at this time, cuttings are planted in the ground. Planting The layering is carried out in the fall. When filling out the work in the fall, you need to have time to plant a derail at least a month before the first frosts. If you are late with the deadlines, seedlings will not have time to get used to new conditions and can freeze. The growth prefers open solar platforms. And also landing in partial shade is possible. It is desirable that the soil be fertile and loose. Wet soil with drainage is suitable. School of landing. Approximately in 2 weeks, the plot is prepared. The ground is dug up, mineral top dressing, humus are introduced And compost. When using fertilizers before planting, you can not additionally feed the bushes over the next few years. The sizes of the holes are calculated depending on the size of the earthen coma. The pit should be a little more spacious. A portion of fertilizers is laid on the bottom (minerals are mixed with humus). Plant the plant is watered with transfer to the site. After 10 minutes it is transplanted. Earth lumps around the roots are left whole. The lunge is filled with the earth, which is triggered around the trunk Circles. Enrage the landing with another watering. The elegantissima variety grows without problems in the southern regions, as it tolerates hot summer. However, with a long drought, the bush can suffer and dry. And also Deren has high winter hardiness. Frost resistance zone - 4 (withstands frosts up to 34 degrees). A strong immune system protects against infections and harmful insects. The whole departure is simple. If the place for growing is chosen correctly, the plant will delight with a charming appearance and Lush crown. The land around young bushes should be periodically loosened in the area of ​​the trunk circle. The site around the plant is covered with organic mulch from humus or peat (chopped wood bark or chips are also suitable). White wood does not need to be covered before the arrival of winter. The plant easily tolerates low temperatures, so the variety will feel comfortable when cultivating in the northern regions. Even if the bush freezes a little, it will quickly return to normal. Covering is necessary Only young plants. The insulation is used to protect the plant in the first year of life after landing in an open area. After the derain does not need to prepare for the winter. Deren of the elegantissima varieties does not need to be irrigated often, but in the first year of life, the plant needs abundant irrigation. It is important to always maintain the soil moderately moist. 2 buckets of water are consumed on one bush. The procedure is carried out only early in the morning or in the evening, when the sun begins to sit down. If you ignore this rule, Burns may appear leaves. Forewoods are optional, since the plant grows without problems in almost any soil. However, to increase decorative properties, they sometimes use fertilizers. 2 weeks before planting, the soil is fertilized. As well as top dressing is laid in landing pits. These nutrients are enough for several years. Filling top dressing is introduced only when the plant is weakened, with illness, or if the shoots were damaged during trimming, and the bush is weakened. Many gardeners They fertilize the earth around young plants with humus. Compulsion compositions are used every 3 years. Top dressing is allowed to dilute with wood ash. Around mid -July, delay is fertilized with compost or peat. A large amount of organic fertilizers when growing white wood is not used. 100 grams are enough. The first procedure is carried out only 2 years after planting the bush for a permanent place of cultivation. At this time, 1/3 of shoots are cut off. And also sanitary cleaning is carried out, in The process of which the plant is cleaned of old, sick and broken branches. At the same time, the plant easily tolerates pruning starting from 4 years of life. This event can be carried out at any time, the main thing is not to choose the period when active sapotage begins. The workflow will depend on the time of work. In the spring, during the formation, the branches are very cut, leaving only 20 centimeters. With the arrival of autumn, the bush is formed to get a plant with a large number of inflorescences. During Work get rid of 3 or 4 leading shoots. Every 3-4 years, they get rid of the old shoots, which are cut almost under the root. Considering that the white wood is actively growing, the formative pruning should be carried out regularly. Otherwise, the plant quickly loses attractiveness."

If you want to get new plants, it's time to do this spring. There are several ways: cuttings - apical or stem, air layering, seeds. The last method is the most difficult, and rarely anyone manages to get seeds, since the dracaen may never bloom at home.

In winter, it can be a little cooler, but not lower than 12-15 ° C, it feels well with normal humidity in the room it is best to water only when the root lump dries in the spring and summer you can feed the plant every six weeks. In autumn and winter, it is not necessary to feed the plant once a year, and in palm trees older than 5 years-every 3-4 years with apical cuttings, stem cuttings, wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove accumulated dust. Avoid the use of shine for leaves on these plants, mold on soil, fungi, worms and mokritsa, drying out the ends of the leaves, formation on the leaves of burns, thrips, spider mites, aphids and shields are unpretentious in leaving all the varieties of this kind of dracaen, Janet Craig is distinguished by a rich dark green uniform color of the foliage without Gorylobkov and intersperse. The plant, as a rule, has one straight trunk 5-6 cm in diameter and can reach a height of up to 4 m. Dracina grows The top, therefore, as height increases, the old leaves fall from the barrel, leaving characteristic gray strips. Despite the fact that the birthplace of dracaena Janet Craig is the tropical forests of Southeast Africa, it is unpretentious in care and is perfectly adapted to growing in room conditions in a sharply continental climatic zone. The plant should be watered as the soil dries (it is recommended to loosen the soil before watering: the dry layer should be at least 2 cm).\n\nExcessive watering For a dracaena, it can be destructive: the plant is easily rotten. In the autumn-winter period, watering can be reduced to 1-2 times a month, but the soil should be loosened at least a week. Water the plant in the pallet with set water at room temperature. Do not neglect regular spraying of leaves. This is especially important if the room is in dry air. To the temperature regime of the dracene is not very sensitive, but prefers cool rooms where the temperature does not rise above 20–22 ° C. But at temperatures below 15 °, the plant can easily die. This type of dracaena does not need good lighting. On the contrary, in bright light, the plant often begins to hurt: the leaves fade, dry along the edges, and yellow spots appear on them. But when transferring to a more shaded place, the dracaen again acquires a healthy look. Often, subject to all growing conditions in the dracaena, signs of the disease are observed: the leaves lose their attractive appearance and fall. The fault is more likely In total, there are small insects and widers: spider mites, thyroid shields, thrips or aphids. At the first signs of the disease, the dracao should be placed in quarantine, isolating from other colors. You can recognize pests by characteristic damage on the leaves:\n\n\n\ta web of a spider mite leaves characteristic rusty spots and a white sticky web, which covers the entire plant;\n\tThe thyroidists feed on cell juice and leave brown plaques on the leaves;\n\tthe presence of tripps can be determined by oblong white or light silver spots;\n\tAphid forms noticeable colonies of whitish or light green larvae. The first 3-4 growing season of the dracene is actively growing and needs regular transplants into a large container. Each subsequent container should be taken a little more than the previous one so that the roots can adapt normally. The transplant is best done in late February or early March, when the plant wakes up and enters the phase of active photosynthesis and vegetation. To the bottom of the pot (approximately 1/6 of the total volume) should be poured with drainage: expanded clay or small pebbles. The soil is universal with the addition of sand, wood coal and vermiculite. In indoor conditions, the dracaen is well propagated by cuttings. To do this, use the upper part of the stem with leaves. The stem is cut off at a distance of 15–20 cm from the crown and placed in the ground. In this case, the stem with leaves is placed vertically, and fragments of the stem without leaves can be placed horizontally, sprinkled with earth in the middle. Then 2 The end gives the beginning of 2 new trunks. Due to the large size, Dzhanet Craig is far from always convenient to keep in indoor conditions, but it is an excellent decoration for interiors of offices, hospitals and other institutions. Dark greens look great against the background of white or any light walls, while it does not take up much space and does not need constant care, tolerant of drafts, irregular watering and shading.|||Fragrans African tropics fragrant (fragrance) is one of the most common in the culture of the types of dracaena tall average growth rate in the natural habitat of the plant is about 610, when growing in pots, the bottom of the old plants is practically absent, so the barrel looks bare, narrow up to 100 to 10 glossy green and broad stripes, the color of which ranges from light green to yellow green and stripes and with a simple perianth consisting of six leaves, small creamy, pleasant aroma resembling the smell of honey or hay in room conditions will not bloom the room can grow under a variety of illumination - from open sunny spaces to low -light rooms the best summer temperature for growing happiness - from 18 ° C to 25 ° C, consisting of soil consisting compost, deciduous and turf land with the addition of peat and pure large sand is resistant to drought the cultivation of the Massangeana variety in open ground is possible only in areas belonging to frost resistance zones from 10th to 12th 10 (from -1 ° to +4 °), 11 (from +4 ° to +10 °), 12 (from +10 ° to +13 °) you can wipe the leaves with a soft, damp clip or occasionally “rinses” the plant under a warm dash, but after that Be sure to shit off the water from it unpretentious in the departure of the dracaen belongs to the genus of tropical evergreen plants represented in the natural environment with trees and shrubs from Family of asparagus. In the nature of the varieties of these crops, there are more than a hundred, while many of them are growing for landscaping public premises, as well as for breeding at home. The fragrant dracao is most often bred in pots, since the plant develops perfectly in the conditions of apartments and offices, does not require a special and time -consuming approach to leaving, in addition, is distinguished by decorative attractiveness.\n\nToday, Drazenes Fragrance is attributed to indoor plants, from the category of \"trees of happiness.\" There is an opinion that culture blooms only where a favorable atmosphere develops, there are no conflicts, love and mutual understanding reign. In apartments and houses, you can find a variety of varieties of this culture that will vary in the color and appearance of their leaves. Today, more than two dozen types of fragrant dracaena are actively grown. All existing varieties stand out in an attractive appearance, in addition, they develop well In the premises.\n\nAmong the most popular, it is worth highlighting several cultures.\n\n\n\t \"Compact\". Most often, it is this variety that is grown at home. This plant is a small bush, the height of which is in the range of 2 meters. The perennial has quite dense stems, as well as a beautiful and lush crown, which is formed using glossy foliage. Fragrant dracaena does not pose any danger to humans during growing at home. The plant is not poisonous, does not emit dangerous and toxic substances. Young plants will be more correct to transplant into a large container later every two seasons. As for adults, they will be enough for them to one 3 years of years. A fragrant dracaena that has grows in the house for a very long time, will be able to develop normally without a change of container, but in such crops it is necessary to remove part of the upper soil layer every year, replacing it with fresh and nutritious soil mixtures.\n\nThe process of transplanting the dracaena itself occurs by Transvading. The essence of the method is the maximum preservation of the earthen coma of the plant. This is necessary in order to protect the roots of the flower from possible damage, as well as speed up the adaptation process in a new place.\n\nAs for only purchased flowers, they should stand in a house in a quarantine mode for about 14 days, after which, assessing the state of culture, you can already decide on a transplant. The best time for all work will be the spring months. The most successful time for In order to propagate the exotic in the conditions of the house, spring will become.\n\nYou can achieve the desired result in several ways.\n\n\n\tWith the help of rooting cuttings. Good results demonstrate the first option, so beginners who want to get a new plant on their own should resort to this way. Material for propagation is obtained from the top. Cuttings must be placed in greenhouse conditions using moist soil mixture in a small container covered with a film. As a rule, after 1–2 For months, the cuttings will have roots, after which the young plant can be rooted in a separate container. The molding for a fragrant room dracaena is a mandatory event for it to bloom and have decorative attractiveness. It is best to plan such work at the beginning of spring, when the culture comes out of the rest phase. Pruning is carried out with a sharp knife, cutting off the top of the shoot, which can be rooted in the future. The cut place must be treated with crushed activated Coal, and the flower itself is removed in a shaded place for several weeks. After time, young buds are formed on this part of the flower. Fragrant dracaena stands out by its resistance to a variety of ailments that can develop on other indoor flowers. However, errors regarding care can become a provocateur of diseases. First of all, it can be rot, which is formed on plants at too low air temperatures in the room and excess soil moisture. Signs of the disease The black ends of the leaves will perform. To get rid of this ailment, you should change the conditions of cultural content, as well as remove the green mass damaged by the disease. And also a pot with a flower will need to be moved to a dry place without drafts, remove the excess accumulated moisture if possible.\n\nAmong the pests, which can show interest in dracaena, it is worth highlighting a spider mite, aphid and shield. The safest for humans and effective for plants will be methods of combating Pests with the help of folk remedies. It can be a culture processing with a soap solution, a warm shower. With too much insects, it is necessary to resort to the help of insecticides.|||Compacta southeast Africa fragrant (fragment) compact plant in the form of mini-panma slender, green color, slightly curved short-free dark green with deeper green veins, green room scattered or partial shelf, a cabinet in the depths of the room in the summer in the summer of +20 ... +27 ° C, and in winter +15 ... +17 ° C from moderate to moderate to moderate to moderate to moderate high drainage, containing peat moss, perlite 1-2 times a week twice a month in the spring-summer period regular as the plant grows with stem Cuts are dangerous with spider mugs and marty worms unpretentious in departure the first mention of dracaena is found in the work of Karl Linnaeus, published in 1767 after visiting Africa and Canary Islands. It was this great biologist who gave her such a colorful and intriguing name. In translation, the word \"dracaena\" means \"female dragon.\" What is not surprising, because the plant in its natural environment can grow up to six meters in height and has a very unusual appearance, something reminiscent of a dragon of legends.\n\nThe Russian name, according to the Dahl dictionary, sounds like a \"dragon.\" It was in the XIX century, after the release of the scientific article by Linnaeus, that some species of dracaena began to cultivate as decorative plants for home and garden. Despite the ease of content of the bush of the Dracin compact, it is necessary to observe a number of rules that will allow him to feel good and delight his owner with a healthy look. It should be remembered that proper care at home is the key longevity of any plant. After the acquisition of the bush of the Dracin compact, first of all, you should pay attention to watering. Despite the fact that the plant loves moisture and regular spraying, it does not tolerate soil flooding. That is, it is necessary to water abundantly, but, avoiding swamping. The best option is considered to be re -watering, after drying two or three centimeters of the upper soil. Due to the fact that the compact dracaena practically does not bloom at home, and The side shoots appear infrequently, its reproduction is carried out by cuttings. To do this, the top of the “uterine” plant is cut into 10 or 15 centimeters and put in water temperature water, in which one tablet of activated carbon is already dissolved. The first roots appear on the cuttings a week after trimming.|||Marginata Madagascar, Mauritan Marginate (bordered) indoor trend with a lignified stem, a high -growing slowly growing from 100 to 1,500, the stem of young specimens straight, in mature plants it is thick and branched, with age it is strongly exposed and lunitized by linear narrow 50–2–2 green, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red, red red. Red-raspberry or pink border of the Kaima Small white pleasant in the natural environment blooms in the spring, it is extremely difficult to get flowering in the room Western, southern orientation, may require several hours of direct sunlight in the depths of the room opposite the window, if the plant is located on the southern window, it is necessary to shade moderately sole content (+18- +25 ° C) High humidity (60% or more: Tropics all year round; typical humidity in the middle lane) slightly acidic, dietary abundant watering 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times 2-3 times a week fertilizer only during active growth (at least during the rest) is easy to care The marginate dracaena grows up. If necessary, trimming the leaves remaining near the upper part of the barrel. Each sheet is bordered, has red and green stripes that make the plant colorful, although it does not bloom. Such a palm tree is easy to grow at home, while indoors will allow a wide range of temperatures. To achieve the best result, you should choose a place where there is a lot of light, but there are no direct sunlight. This flower remains rather slim and high even after Many years of growth and always looks great. Its rods are hard and strong, so they can perfectly stay without additional supports. Perhaps this is one of the cheapest indoor plants that are easiest to care for. It is not so difficult to care for dracaena at home. It grows rapidly, so timely pruning is required, unless you want to have a high palm tree. It will be necessary to control the tree for the presence of spider mites that live and eat in Mostly on the bottom of the foliage. To remove them, it is not necessary to use chemicals, just put the flower in the bath and rinse the leaves under a large pressure of water, for example, using a shower. After the purchase, you will need to transplant the dracae into a large container. For this, the house needs land, a pot with good drainage. The soil can be bought ready or make it yourself. Before transplantation, they do not use fertilizer for a month, then they also wait until the tree is acclimatized, otherwise on it An additional load will be provided.\n\nIt is necessary to transplant the plant in the spring, until the growing season began and it is still in a state of sleep. As a rule, they are engaged in transplantation when the container becomes too small and the root system can no longer develop normally. Since getting the seeds of this plant is not so simple, the cuttings remains the simplest and most affordable option for breeding the dracaena. There are three main ways:\n\n\n\ttrunk;\n\ttop;\n\tAir Dishasis. If Talking about diseases and pests, this plant infrequently suffers from them, but still, crop plants have to face a number of problems, and this is not only a spider mite, which can be washed off with simple water to get rid of it.

After planting, they are necessarily watered.\n\tCherling. This method is usually used to propagate rare varieties of oregano. Cuttings are cut in the spring. Each of them should have at least a few internodes. Correct cuttings in mini-fuels. After the appearance of full -fledged roots, the plants are planted in open ground. They take root in a new place very quickly.\n\tLayering. For the propagation of oregano, powerful stalks of plants are used. They are carefully bend to the surface of the soil and digging. In the future, layering is regularly watered with warm water. Over time, small roots appear on the buried part of the plant. The next spring, the stem can be separated from the maternal plant. This can be done with both a sharp knife and a shovel. The young plant is immediately planted on a new site.\n\tSeeds. In nature, Oregano is propagated by seeds. Gardeners can sow them not only in special containers, but also directly into the soil. It should be borne in mind that in open ground seedlings appear later. Seeds for planting oregano are collected in September. The fruits are dried, and then grind with their hands. After that, the mass Sent through a sieve.

The roots do not touch. Thanks to this, the oregano grows in one place for several years.\n\nIt is recommended to cut oregano on sunny days. The collected plants are necessarily dried. Do this in a well -ventilated place. The shoots are pre -assembled in bundles and gently bandaged twine. If desired, the stems can be dried in a horizontal position. They are laid out with a thin layer on paper and regularly turned over.\n\nWhen the shoots dried, it is necessary to cut off the entire foliage from the stems.

The shoots will appear in any case.\n\nIn this case, there are other methods of propagation of culture.\n\n\n\tDivision of the bush. Only adults and healthy plants can be propagated in this way. The bush must be carefully extracted from the ground. In the process, you need to act carefully so as not to damage the roots. Then the bush is cut with a shovel or knife into several parts. Each of them should have several strong buds. Next, the separated parts of the plant are planted in holes of a suitable size. Immediately after planting, the bushes are abundantly watered.\n\tCherging. This is another popular method of propagation of oregano. Healthy cuttings are cut off from adult plants. There should be about 4 on each of them internodes. Cut cuttings are covered with a film. In such a mini-train, they are kept until the first roots appear. Immediately after that they are planted in open ground.\n\tPropagation with layering. This method of propagation of herbaceous plants is used less often than others. In the process, the stem is carefully bend to the ground and is fixed using a metal bracket. The selected plot is sprinkled with earth, and then watered. Such layering is rooted during the year. After that, the bush is neatly separated from The maternal plant is transplanted to a new place. As a rule, oregano is grown as a perennial.

Closed young cones are brought to the house and dried, after which they open. Next, the processing is carried out: the seeds are soaked in a solution of potassium permanganate; put in a pallet with a warm sand substrate; after that they put the container in the refrigerator for hardening. The method with competent performance of all actions will ensure the appearance of seedlings, but many sprouts may not have such a desirable blue color. Therefore, the cuttings method are more popular. To do this, cut off young Shoots from fir trees that are more than 10 years old. It is better to take erect branches with bark - this will ensure the harmony of the future New Year's beauty. Small incisions are made on the heel, from which the root system will subsequently grow. You can immediately eat the shoots, they are placed in prepared soil - a mixture of sand, peat, turf and sheet ground over a drainage layer of gravel. A pot is placed in a dark room. It is advisable to regularly warm the soil, then the root system will be formed more. Choosing a place For landing, it is of great importance - if you plant a Christmas tree in a shadow or even partial shade, it will lose its contrasting color. Therefore, it is recommended to plant in an open place. The tree loves humidity and fertile, loose soil with good drainage. The soil can be slightly acidified. The main thing is that stagnation of water is not observed, due to which the plant can get sick and die. The preparation and landing of the seedling can be given. As a drainage material, broken brick, gravel or coarse-grained sand is used. Layer It should reach 15 cm in the Earth. Depending on the sizes of the spruce, it is provided for the depth of the landing pit at 30-70 cm. If the trees are planted by a group or near the plants, a distance of 3 m. Lunka is observed by a substrate of the same mixture as for cuttings. In case of depleted soil, it is allowed to fertilize the Earth with a “nitroammofoski” or a complex of mineral additives for conifers. From a pot or container, the plants are taken with an earthen lump and gently placed in the hole, placing The root neck is at the level of the soil surface.

During the spring time of the crown of the fir trees, they are sprayed with an epinum solution, and also feed fertilizers for coniferous varieties and peat mixed with the ground. In the fall, peat is also sprinkled near the roots. In winter, small Christmas trees are covered with spruce and burlap. Tie the twigs of this The breeds are not necessary - they are strong enough to withstand the severity of the snow mass. The “bialobok” does not need the decorative formation of the crown, especially since this procedure can cripple a tree - the crown, as a rule, is not restored, and new shoots can grow for a long time. But sanitary pruning is needed to get rid of the plant from damaged and dried twigs. Sometimes this is necessary if spruce is affected by pests or fungal disease. Derevo is quite rare, but only With improper care. Due to waterlogging, the spruce wither, its needles crumble. Different types of parasitic fungi are guilty of this.

I willy the purple “Mayak” is very decorative: in the summer it delights with its openwork foliage, and in winter her reddish branches look spectacular against the background of snow.|||Nana purple is used to decorate the coastal line of water bodies, to create wood-shrub groups, especially in areas filled with spring waters, good for low cut hedges, as well as for creating various geometric shapes in a small garden of regular style and there are no 30-40 years, there is no handsome leaflet bushes of a bushes of low-grow up to 2 to 3 widely open spherical thinner than that of the main type, naked, elegant brown with a reddish tint and with a bluish raid (with age, the color changes to gray-green) brown with a reddish tint almost opposite, narrow, thin-skinned bluish-blue or silver-green at the top (in the fall-yellow) less than the main type of 3-4 is not strongly developed, well strengthens the soil differs in a small size of a semi-coal-coal-shaped bush, more thin, numerous shoots than the main species, and with small leaves of silver-green color and 2.6-2.8 purple are absent in Marte-April before the foliage blooms or almost simultaneously low-cost in the early spring, to obtain decorative plants, it is recommended to plant in illuminated places, in the shaded crown the distance between plants is stretched-100 cm of better development reaches wet and fertile soils to water generously and is often made in the early spring to maintain the crown in a more decorative state. Early in the spring, the first 2-3 years is drought to resist the high trunks Two or three layers of burlap should be wrapped in order to avoid frostobine 5 (from -29 ° to -23 °) regular loosening and mulching of the soil average Russia and the purple “nana”, related to red spherical plants, are now more and more actively used. You can meet it at the residential cottage and at the administrative building. For information: the everyday names of “Krasnotal” and “yellow -haired” mean the same plant. Reddish coloring is typical for elongated, almost naked shoots of this variety. Purple willows tolerate frosts well, and therefore they are grown very actively.\n\nTo cultivate such plants, soils with a variety of fertility are suitable. The height of the shrub reaches about 1.5 m. It grows in width to 2 m. Despite the rather impressive size, subtlety and grace of branches inside the spherical crown gives the culture a unique charm. From the inside, the branches are painted in a lemon tone with an orange tint. The best planting material is the one Sell ​​special nurseries. Propagation with cuttings with direct landing in the ground is allowed where the shrub will live constantly. Planting the plant is preferably closed roots. In this case, it will take root better. \"Nana\" is not viable in relation to the soil. She also tolerates a dry time well, but it is better to plant an willow on moderately wet or very wet areas.\n\nImportant: this plant cannot be planted where there is little light. Tall trees and Powerful bushes, other natural and artificial sources of shadow affect it extremely negatively. The minimum size of the landing pit is 0.5x0.5 m. More correctly focus on the specific dimensions of the Earth’s lump (with a significant excess). In this case, the roots will definitely remain intact. Iva purple will create a large ball bush only with a period between shrubs at least 1 m. Although the yard of the dwarf is growing rapidly and unpretentious, it is still necessary to care for it diligently. In the spring watering It is required only with a long drought. Focus on the state of shoots. From June to August, inclusively watering the Nana willow is required only on hot days. Recommend a crown, moisturizing foliage and branches. To avoid sunburn, they work in the morning or when the sun rolls. Iva \"Nana\" is usually propagated by cuttings. They are taken from a plant that has lived for at least 2 years. It is better to work in the spring, until the leaves have time to appear. Branches are taken from the Donor. No need to take a lot - enough a plot of 150-200 mm, where there are 6 kidneys. Sometimes it is better to play it safe and take a fragment of the escape with 7 buds for cuttings. Below the stalk is cut at an angle of 45 degrees. From above, the incision should go under 90 degrees. The blanks are preferably kept in water. If for some reason this is impossible, planting material is planted in the ground to a depth of 50 to 80 mm. It is chosen so that there are exactly 2 kidneys outside. When growing in the ground, seedlings deserve systematic watering. Sometimes they carry out and Special processing, accelerating rooting.\n\nAdditionally, this process allows for preliminary placement in greenhouses and greenhouses. After the formation of the root complex, landing is possible to a stable place. There are formed holes suitable in size. As soon as the kidneys swell, they make a new cut-already 250-300 mm. The lower sections are covered with notches. After that, seedlings are immersed in water. As soon as the kidneys are formed, you can transplant them into open land. Close willow, however, You can do it in the fall - you just have to wait until the leaf fall ends, and the plant will enter the phase of rest. The branches are cut off and put in cellophane bags, where wet sand is added in advance. The lower parts of the shoots should be buried in it. Storage of blanks - until spring. To better appear roots, special stimulants are used. If everything is done correctly, no problems should arise. Decorative willow is practically not sick. Parasites also usually bypass it. But still required A systematic inspection that allows you to identify extraneous spots, wounds or larvae. The main threat is powdery mildew and black spotting. You can avoid their appearance due to spring top dressing with nitrogen. If the disease has already developed greatly, it is useless to treat - you can only burn the affected plant.\n\nIva is subjected to aggression of flower flies, willow leaflets. They are able to badly harm the early leaves, absorbing juices. The fight against parasites involves the use of Bordeaux fluid. If she Ineffective, more modern insecticides are used. But with a competent approach, there will simply be no risk. Sometimes they are faced with the fact that the willow has dried. This is due to the invasion of alder weevils. Along with the drying of the foliage, the pest manifests itself in the stems. Patient rods destroy either in the fall, when the beetles stop making masonry, or in the spring - no later than mid -May. You can notice larvae in July and in the first decade of August. Decorative willows are so original that they can enter into a variety of compositions in the garden and on the landscape. In the summer, the plant will delight observers with a variety of colors of leaves. In the cold season, her branches look very attractive against the background of snow. Since willow can hold the ground well, it can be planted:\n\n\n\tnear the river;\n\talong the lake;\n\ton the shore of the pond;\n\tin swampy places;\n\tOn weak ground.|||Placutschii gnom V.I.

It depends specifically on the variety. IVA \"weeping dwarf\" refers to hybrid varieties, since it appeared thanks to the efforts of the breeders of the Urals. This variety refers to dioecious plants. It has yellow-green flowers that form the so-called earrings. Iva flowering enters the second decade of May. Usually at the same time, leaflets are also formed. IVE \"Boarding dwarf\" is a year -round decoration of the landscape. So that she does not hurt and delights eyes surrounding with their luxurious beauty, it should be planted in the right place. This plant loves to grow separately, away from other trees. It grows perfectly near small ponds. A beautiful place will be a park zone. This variety becomes an adornment of many gardens and squares. It should be noted that it grows perfectly in the sun. Iva dies in the shade, so you always need to ensure the flow of sunlight to the tree.\n\n\"Boarding gnome\" excellently grows in a fertile soil with a moderate level of humidity. Even when stagnation of water, the plant will not disappear. In soil with a poor set of beneficial substances, a tree can also grow. But it must be understood, if the willow will grow away from reservoirs, then in the hot season it will need regular watering. IVA \"weeping gnome\" is characterized by tenderness and beauty, so many seek to have such a tree on their personal plot. It can be propagated by several ways.\n\n\n\tSeeds. This method is impossible Name effective, since the seeds are poorly skipped, but refers to possible options.\n\tCuttings. This option is the main thing. It is necessary to cut a twig, which is only 1 year old, then cut it into several cuttings. It is worth leaving only 2 leaflets in the upper part, and remove all the others. We necessarily dip the stalk in the \"Kornevin\", because with its help it will take root faster. Planting is best done in a shaded place. After planting the stalk should be covered with a plastic bottle, enough There will be only half of it. The appearance of leaves indicates that the stalk has rooted, so the bottle can already be removed. But it is necessary to remember the watering.\n\tLayering. This option is also popular, but not guaranteed. Its essence lies in the fact that a young twig should be pinned to the ground, and make an incision in the place where the tanying with the soil is carried out. We fall asleep with the ground. Already in the fall, you can expect a twig to root. If the roots appear, then the twig is already possible Cut from willow and plant in a suitable place. IVE is a central element in the landscape design of the house site. She attracts enthusiastic eyes.|||Sverdlovskaja Isvilistaja is a winding is used for group and single plantings, the creation of wood-shrub groups and seasonal compositions and a hybrid and a tree with a winding trunk, a tree-like 4-5 4 grows a rapidly medium density, a spherical stainless or red-brown, weakly pubescent branches and reddish-brown-brown-browned branches and reddish, weakly pubescent branches and The trunk is dark green, but due to the exfoliating gray, shiny cuticle at a distance look gray with a steel shade, winding lanceolate Light green from above, the blue from the bottom is weakly pubescent from above, from below moderately pubescent narrow, long is characterized by a combination of the weedness and winding of shoots and leaves male yellow lacks of May.

Culture appeared in the Cretaceous period (it began about 145 million years ago) and existed along with dinosaurs. Today, on the planet of varieties of willow, there are more than 170 species growing on all continents. Different varieties began to be actively used in Landscape art designers of England in the 19th century. The plant has an extensive root system that perfectly strengthens the shores. One of the most stable and monumental EV. It grows rapidly, and its strong trunk does not need a garter (maybe only in the first year of landing). The tree grows to 7 meters (sometimes up to 10). By autumn and winter, the sunny side of the plant acquires a brown tint. Its flowering is abundant, but does not differ in colorfulness, since the variety has mixed Earrings: male and female. Foliage casts a satin sheen.\n\nThe posterior willow loves sunlight, prefers fresh and fertile soils. This species looks amazing in open space, where he can show itself in all its glory.\n\nAn interesting fact. Many artists are happy to draw willow on their canvases. It is in the paintings of such outstanding artists as Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh, Ivan Shishkin. In Russia, winding willow is especially popular. Wherever she grew up, willow brings peace and harmony to this place. A tree of this species is perfectly formed by pruning, with the help of which it can be given the desired shape. Planting a plant with decorative indicators will transform any territory. Variations of this species are a dwarf tree.\n\nA spectacular tree can be grown from a young seedling, but he needs proper care. Care, like landing, is not difficult, the main thing is to decide where the willow will be. It is advisable to plant it in good The zone illuminated by the sun. Almost all willow need an abundance of moisture, so Sverdlovsk willow is recommended to be planted next to the reservoir. The first stage includes cutting cuttings, after which they are buried in the ground and supported high humidity. The care of the Sverdlovsk willow includes pruning, which should be carried out annually, and the formation of the crown. If you do not comply with these rules, it will quickly thicken. A cosmetic haircut can give a winding plant a different shape. Care The plant is quite simple, since the willow is unpretentious, does not get sick and practically not attractive for malicious insects.\n\nBasic care rules.\n\n\n\tThe branches need to be cut in early spring. In summer, only cosmetic pruning is carried out.\n\tIt is advisable to treat every spring and autumn with the means against the fungus.\n\tThe plant does not need to tie branches and install the supports - from this they dry.\n\tWatering wood in the fall and spring should be carried out 2 times a month, but only if there was no rain. In the case of very hot weather, watering can be done weekly.\n\tImmediately after the soil warms up, you need to make organic mineral fertilizer. In the summer, it is advisable to have a fertilizer until mid -July.\n\tThe soil is loosening in spring, summer and autumn.\n\tIn the spring, pruning is carried out.

To do this, the twig simply stick into Moisturized land. You can break a branch and put it in the water so that it starts the roots. After that, the plant can be planted.\n\nYou can cut the cuttings until the end of August, starting in spring, holding the thickness of 2 cm in diameter and 30 cm long. Cuttings are accepted immediately with a sufficient amount of moisture - you can propagate willow any variety. The plant is slightly affected by pests and fungal diseases, but you should still periodically treat the trunk circle for prevention. This It is carried out by loosening and digging in the fall. Moreover, in addition to loosening, it is advisable to make fertilizers. The soil is dug by no more than 10 cm deep. In summer, this procedure is carried out 2-3 times.\n\nAfter rain, loosening the soil is a great idea, so moisture evaporates slowly. In autumn, loosening falls in October, after which they use a thick layer of peat for mulching. The winding willow looks great, it is not surprising that it is used in landscape design. These trees even look beautiful In winter. Sverdlovsk varieties are adapted for life in areas with long colds. Their distinctive features are decorativeness and vitality. In the sun, the color of the bark becomes brown, and the crown can have an oval or pyramidal shape."

It is recommended to contribute to the growth of new ones to transplant kalata every 1-2 years in The new soil with good drainage ability to divide regularly with a damp soft cloth to remove the dust and maintain them healthy and shiny requires a special care of trypses, a spider mite of Kalatea Warshevich, large oval leaves up to 50 cm in size. They are located on short stems. Their surface is decorated with an elegant pattern: in light stripes, diverging from the center to the edge. The plant is often called a \"prayer flower\", and all because with the onset of darkness it is like As if praying: the leaves rise and twist. At the same time, the lower part of the sheet plate of a bright purple color is exposed. Calatei is blooming in the spring-summer period. This is a very beautiful process from which it is impossible to take your eyes off, a room with flowering kalatea is immediately transformed. Large buds are located on short peduncles between the leaves. The flower is sensitive to sharp differences. Therefore, throughout the year, the temperature in the room is maintained within +19.23 degrees Celsius. It is forbidden to take out the calateus on the balcony, and it is undesirable to put it on the windowsill. If, nevertheless, a flowerpot with a plant stands by the window, you can not open the window. Drafts and sharp temperature changes can destroy the delicate flower. Kalatate loves humidity, ideally if this indicator is 90%. It is difficult to create such conditions in the apartment, so the flower is placed near the decorative fountain or aquarium. In extreme cases, a vessel with water can be placed near the flowerpot. If the plant is enough moisture, It grows gorgeous leaves - large and bright. Kalatea, as a bright representative of tropical forests, loves water. Watering should be frequent, but without fanaticism. The soil waterlogging is also dangerous - rotting of the roots may develop. In winter, Kalatheus is watered once a week. In the spring-summer period, an active vegetation begins in the plant, so the frequency of watering is increased by 2 times. This schedule is approximate, since first of all they are guided by the upper layer of the soil - if it has dried, then, then, The plant requires the next portion of water. The soil should be loose nutritious with a low acidity. It can be purchased in a specialized store or prepared by yourself. To do this, they mix in equal amounts of peat, humus and deciduous land, add a little sand. There must be drainage at the bottom of the pot so that the excess moisture does not stagnate or destroy the roots. The flowerpot is chosen wide and low, this is justified by a feature of the root system. Well, if the pot is Clay or stone - plastic contains chemicals. You are transplanted young -dodged every year. If the plant is adult, then once every 3-4 years. The favorable time for this is spring, when the plant is full of life and strength. The transplant is carried out by the transshipment method: the earthen lump with roots is carefully moved to the prepared flowerpot and sprinkled with soil to the top. Water with water and left in a warm place for rooting, the next watering is carried out after 3-4 days. Get New specimens can be in several ways: rhizomes, cuttings and seeds. The easiest way to propagate is the rhizome. This method is suitable only if the “maternal” plant is at least three years old. Propagated by the rhizome of Kalatei in early spring during transplantation, this is done as follows: the plant is removed from the pot, carefully separated the earth; the root and the bush itself is neatly divided into parts, it is important that at least three developed shoots remain on each of them; then the resulting Bushes are transplanted into pre -prepared fertile soil. Kalatea is a delicate flower, he reacts sensitively to poor care. The disease is primarily reflected in the condition of the leaves. Therefore, they are paid close attention. We list the most common problems with the leaves and their causes: they are twisted and dry - the room is too dry; pale and stretched out in length - the flower is not enough light (and sometimes, on the contrary, there is too much light); yellow with brown spots - waterlogging - waterlogging soils; brown dry spots - the plant was subjected to aggressive effects of sunlight.|||Calathea Crocata, Kalatea Safrannoy Crocata View Low-Rotten 40-45 Large 30 cm in length, Lengered, slightly wavy, smooth, dark green with white symmetrical stripes, purple and bright yellow with orange-bracts.

Only in this case you can wait for healthy development and high -quality flowering. First of all, take care of lighting, since this representative of the flora needs a lot of light. The brightness of the light It should be combined with distraction, direct rays are contraindicated to him in the same way as dimming. The best solution will be the placement of Calathea on the window from the side of the East or West. In the winter, it is recommended to use additional light sources, for example, phytolamps, otherwise the flower will not grab natural light. If you do not fulfill these conditions, the foliage will not be quite saturated, fade, grind. After buying, the plant can be transplanted immediately, but it is better to give it a few days for adaptation. Calathea transplanted in the midst of spring, the optimal month is April. Every year this procedure is subjected to a growing young flower. It is enough to transplant a mature plant every 3 years. The algorithm of actions during transplantation is as follows: use pots of clay or plastic; the soil can be prepared independently or purchased the finished; the drainage layer at the bottom is required, expanded clay, beaten brick, foam, pebbles; root system, it requires a careful Relations in the process of transplantation; if the rhizomes are woven, they are washed with warm water; if not, the roots are not cleaned from the ground, moved directly to the lump, and the remaining space is added to the soil.

Cacerons: choose strong Cut the side processes, cut the part on which there are foliage; place in a container with a growth stimulant; then transfer to the soil - loose, moistened, with drainage; perfect substrate - with peat and sand; cover with a film, periodically give air access, water. Calatein diseases are a rather rare phenomenon, they most often occur due to improper care: drafts, sharp temperature jumps, dry air. The most common problem of the flower - his leaves dry. There may be several reasons. For example, the air is overdried - if the plant is not enough humidity, it begins to dry out. The problem is solved by a humidifier or daily spraying. It also negatively affects the state of the leaves of poor -quality water, sunburn. Therefore, use only defended water, and provide dispersed lighting. Loads can not only dry, but also twist - this is also a common problem. No need to confuse painful twisting with natural in night period. Think about whether your plant has encountered the following factors: insufficient watering, drought; cold or intelligent water for watering; excess of soil moisturizing and, as a result, rotting of roots; cold temperature, draft.|||Lancipholia (lanceolate) type Medium-sized 80-90 Long length 30 cm lanceolate wavy, smooth light green with dark spots of oval shape, located along the central vein of purple color and resembling small leaves green and pinkish colossus, consisting of three small snowstorms from late May to mid-August to the soil Kalatea mixtures make special requirements.

You can always buy ready -made land in the store, the same composition is suitable for the flower as used for Senpolia. If there is time and the necessary materials, it is possible to make the soil yourself, the scheme is very simple: one part of perlite or vermiculite is added to two parts of peat or moss of sphagnum. The drainage layer is of great importance, it is better to make it from small stones. The beginning of the spring season on top of the pot is added peat to improve soil nutrition. The earth should be moist, but it cannot be swamped, otherwise the root system will simply rot. The leaves are spear-shaped with alternating ovals of dark green and purple lower side. This indoor plant is attributed to the Marataceae family. In nature, it grows in the tropics of Solar Brazil. The plant is chosen primarily for its interesting, attractive foliage. It is not suitable for the garden Since it cannot grow in cold or arid regions, since the homeland of Kalatea is tropical forests. In Brazil, it is also called a rattling snake or a prayer flower. The growth grows quite voluminous, the maximum height is 90 centimeters. The foliage has a lanceolate shape, it is quite large, but thin. The edges of the leaves are slightly wavy. Greens are collected in sockets, the petioles are short. Kalataeus is safely ranked for species that do not require much attention, since this flower Unpretentious and resistant to most diseases. The plant can be a short period of time in adverse conditions, but with a long non -compliance with the regime of the foliage, it becomes sluggish and even blackens. If the crop does nothing, then the flower will just die. You can evaluate the beauty of this tropical flower only by providing it with warmth, moisture and enough light. For Kalatea, the ideal place will be the windowsill, where the sun's rays fall through the curtains scattered, and most of the time there is a shadow. Ideally, windows from the western or east side are suitable, you can use the southern one, but only move the flower away from the glass. If the direct sunlight comes on on the leaves, they appear like small brown spots, which then dry out. With the onset of winter, the flower can be rearranged under additional lighting.

It is worth considering the most frequent diseases and pests. The most common type of pests attacking Kalatheus is triples. They appear most often with insufficient humidity, but in the presence of high temperatures. If the plant It was pointedly covered with light spots, it is time to take measures. Spots can change the color to darker, after which the foliage will begin to dry and fall. Special means - insecticides, soap solution and top dressing will help to cope with the problem. If the plant is covered with a black film, which means that a sooty mushroom is overcome. Film formation does not allow air circulation, violates photosynthesis and the plant dies. A solution of soap will help to get rid of adversity. If you noticed on a flower Small brown insects are the invasion of shields. They suck vital juices from foliage, after which the leaves dry out. In this case, special equipment and a solution of soap will help."

Its author was Lemoir. The variety was intended for decorating gardens and palace ensembles, at that time became a splash. The original name, Boule de Neige translates as “snowball” or “a lump of snow”. And it is very suitable for this subspecies, because during flowering it really looks like a winter snowfield. Buldenege belongs to the type of ordinary red viburnum. This is a deciduous shrub with a height of 3.5 meters and a diameter of 2 m. A fast-growing plant, a full growth mark reaches at 7-10 years, then stops. The life of such a culture is about half a century. Crone is spreading, rounded in shape. Shoots They grow straight. The egg -shaped large leaves are seized along the edges. In the spring and summer they have a light green color, but in the fall they become red-pink.

At this time, large, up to 10 cm in size, inflorescences have a dense structure and spherical shape are formed on the bush. In the early days, the flowers are greenish, then they acquire Snow-white color. Flashing specimens will be pink. The long history of this variety allowed gardeners to fully deal with the pros and cons of bullydenezh. Kalina has the following advantages: decorativeness of foliage; large -sized inflorescences that change their color; high winter hardiness; in addition, the variety can grow in the conditions of the city, since the plant has no effects. However, summer residents advise protecting him from diseases and pests. Viburnum Buldenege has long been intended for decorating plots. This beautiful variety will look great on a well -groomed emerald lawn, and with its help you can interestingly arrange flower beds, recreation areas, artificial ponds. Often, Kalina is planted near dark fences or buildings, then its white inflorescences look especially spectacular. In some cases, viburnum is planted alone, but most often summer residents practice group planting, creating hedges from this delicate plant. Under Kalina You can plant early spring flowers like snowdrops. When they finish flowering, the beauty of the shrub will hide the already unpresentable sprouts. From other plants, bulldogs are more beautiful with conifers that have dark needles, lines, white hydrangea, barberry birch, ash, oak. You can plant viburnum at different times. For example, early spring is distinguished for layering, for dividing the bush - September or October, for cuttings - summer. If there are no bushes on the site, and The new seedling will be purchased, it is better to take an option in a container. Then it can be planted at any time from spring to autumn. Pospering is carried out in the sun or in partial shade. The soil choose loose, drained, fertile, moderately sour. Pits for planting are dug up at a distance of 1.5-2 meters from each other, an approximate width is 70 centimeters, depth-60 cm. The edges of the hole are recommended to swap with a fork. At the bottom of the pit with a 20-centimeter layer, compost is placed. Previously, pour it so that the process is easier. If this is an option with open roots, then it is important to hold for half an hour in warm water. In addition, open roots are shortened on a third with a clean secateur. Then, fertile soil in the form of a mound is poured onto the compost in the hole on top, and a seedling is placed on it. They are thrown with earth, digging it to the level of the root neck. After planting, they immediately trim, cutting the shoots by one third, and if necessary, removing weak or dry specimens. Next Make a watering circle, irrigate the plant well and mulch the bark. Buldenege does not require close attention, he needs standard agricultural measures. It is most necessary to treat irrigation. Kalina loves moisture very much, and in the summer it must be watered 2-3 times a week. If rains often go, the frequency, of course, is reduced. It is important to water the plant until deep autumn, only in this case it will suffer a winter well. You can approve from 2-3 years after planting, subject to placement Plants in fertile soil. In early spring, it is advisable to fertilize with nitrogen, for example, urea, scattering it under the bush. In July, a potassium-phosphorus complex or top dressing for flowering plants is made. Every 3 or 4 years, plants are fertilized in the form of humus or compost. Buldenege reacts well to trimming. For the first year, all inflorescences are removed from the bushes so that the shrub increases the green mass. In the last month of summer, it is recommended to pinch the tops. In the second year, all shoots are cut off, located at a distance of 0.2 meters from the level of soil. When the plant reaches one and a half meters, it can begin to form it. There are different options: ball, stem and others. The most important thing is to finish all the work by July so that the plant can gain strength to winter. The variety of the variety is excellent, shrubs can withstand the temperature up to -40 degrees. Special shelters are not required if it is a south or middle strip. However, in Siberia you need to cut the twigs to a length of 150 centimeters. When it appears, it They are thrown onto the plant. To reduce the percentage of frozen shoots, in this region the bullying is planted near fences and various buildings. In certain years, viburnum can be attacked by various diseases and insects. Of the ailments, powdery mildew is most often found. The plant is covered with a whitish raid, which over 14 days spreads through the bush. For the treatment of viburnum in a bucket of water, 100 grams of soda are diluted and about 50 grams of grated laundry soap are added. Spraying is carried out, When the bush bakes, they make them three times a week. Three pests are affected. It is they who mainly attack Kalina. Sets on the foliage, causes its twisting and stickiness. First, you can try to spray bulldenage with soapy solution. In the absence of a result, \"agravertin\" is used. As well as the soil near the shrub is sprinkled with ash. This insect rises the holes in the foliage. In May, the plant is sprayed with “carbophos”, in August this processing is repeated. Caching. Given The parasite also feeds on foliage. To get rid of it, the plant is treated with an “acture”."

Planted in the fall in late September or spring in April. The species prefers a sunny place without a loved one Lockwater flows. It will grow on the site, which is shaded in the afternoon for several hours or is in partial shade. Ginnal maple is not very demanding on the composition of the soil, but it does not tolerate salted soils and closely located groundwater, as well as wetlands. It grows better on slightly acidic and neutral in composition of the Earth. In soils with a high lime content, it is recommended to use peat as mulch.\n\nSeedlings can be purchased in a crop nursery. These are small trees 2 years of age placed in a container with ground, which is convenient for transportation. It is convenient to plant them even in the summer. In adults, it practically does not need care. During active growth, it is recommended to water, loosen, remove weeds, and feed. The variety is distinguished by wind resistance, tolerates urban gasket well, and was able, heat.\n\nYoung trees in open ground in the first 2-3 years after planting need special shelter. Ginnal maples grown on the stem, The most defenseless before frost. In autumn, the roots and trunk of young trees are necessarily covered. Ginnal maple is propagated by seeds and cuttings. Seeds are collected in the fall, they dry out and become brown. At the end of October, the seeds are buried in fertile soil to a depth of 5 cm. In the spring, stronger plants will germinate. If the seeds are planted only in the spring, they are placed in a container with wet sand and cleaned in the refrigerator for 3 months. In April-May, they are transferred to open ground.\n\nFor The first year, the sprouts are stretched to a height of 40 cm. The shoots should be regularly watered, loosened, and weeds are removed. In the heat, seedlings are shaded from direct rays of the sun. After 3 years, they can be transplanted to a permanent place.\n\nThe cuttings are propagated in the spring immediately after the end of flowering. Choose a strong shoot and cut off about 20 cm long, it must be axillary kidneys. The leaves are removed, the cut place is treated with a growth stimulant. The stalk is immersed in wet sand, covered with a jar or With a plastic bottle, left until rooting - until the kidneys will wake up. They transplant to a permanent place only in a year or two. Most often, the first signs of the disease appear on the leaves: they begin to blacken, dry and crumble in the summer, multi -colored spots are laid on them. This means that the tree fell ill or pests attacked it.\n\nTypes of diseases.\n\n\n\t\n\tFulfinory dew - has the appearance of a small, similar to flour of plaque on a sheet. The plant is treated with ground gray mixed with lime in proportions 2 to 1.\n\t\n\t\n\tCoral spotting - manifests itself in the form of red spots on the bark. Sick areas must be removed, the sections are lubricated with garden var, and the tree is sprayed with copper sulfate.\n\t\n\t\n\tWhite spotting - the disease usually appears at the end of summer, many small white spots are formed on the leaves, in the central part of each spot there is a black dot - this is the place of distribution of a fungal infection. For treatment, use burgundy fluid.\n\t\n\t\n\tBlack spotting - on the leaves Black spots begin to appear with a characteristic yellowish rim. Sprayed with drugs: “HOM”, “Fundazole”, “Fitosporin-M”.

In the spring they are lighter, in the summer they replace their color to bright green, and become in the fall yellow.\n\nIn young seedlings, the bark has a light brown color. Over time, it becomes dark, almost black and is covered with small cracks. In early May, flowers appear on the maple, closer to autumn they are replaced by fruits, which are brownish-yellow shells. It is best to plant maple in early spring or late autumn. The place in which he will grow must be well lit. You can also plant oxide maple in partial shade. The distance between the trees should not be less than 3 meters. If maples are used to create a hedge or alley, then it is enough to leave only 2 meters of free space between them. The pit should be prepared in advance. It is necessary to make it large so that the entire root system of the tree is placed there. At its bottom, before planting, you need to lay out a drainage layer up to 15 centimeters thick. You can use gravel or chopped brick.\n\nThe pit prepared in this way must be filled with a mixture consisting of 3 parts of humus, 1 parts of large sand and 2 parts of sod land. After that, the seedling must be placed in the center of the pit and carefully spread its roots. On top of them you need to sprinkle with earth so that the root neck of the maple is a few centimeters above the surface of the earth. Then the seedling must be well watered. Use at a time at least 3 buckets of water. The trunk circle of maple must be mulched with peat or dry leaves. This tree is not too committed, therefore it does not require special care. It will be enough to water it from time to time and feed it with correctly selected fertilizers. There are several ways to breed this variety of wood. In order for the maple to be able to live as long as possible, it must be protected from various pests and diseases. Most often, coral spotting or fungal diseases affect the tree. Notice that the plant is infected with a fungus is quite simple. In this case, brown spots appear on the surface of the leaves. To solve this problem, Infected branches must be removed, and the tree can be treated with special products.\n\nCoral spotting is also easily recognized. In this disease, the maple branch begins to die, and the bark is covered with burgundy spots. To solve this problem, all damaged branches must be carefully trimmed and burned. The seats of the slices should be immediately treated with garden var. Also, the maple is attacked by insects, which can also harm it too much. These include:\n\n\n\twhiteflies;\n\tMarty Chervets;\n\tweevils. Drummonde maple is often used in landscape design. Despite the large size, it is perfect for both single and group plantings. The maple looks great against the background of coniferous trees and shrubs with dark green leaves.\n\nThis variety is also good for creating alleys. When they are designed, plants are planted at a distance of about 1.5-2 meters from each other. Since the tree grows quickly enough, walk along the alley in the shade of maple trees It will be possible in a couple of years.\n\nAlso, maple can be planted in the recreation area. It gives a large shadow, which means that it can be placed next to the terrace or gazebo. Summing up, we can say that the Drummondi maple is a tree that does not require special care.

Therefore, it can be calmly planted in your country house and after 2-3 years to enjoy the fruits of your work.|||Crimson Sentry is used in alleys, group, ordinary landings, as a color accent in wood-shust groups, a slender and rather compact tree Medium-sized 8 4 dense pyramidal short, 5-7-lobed red purple purple bronze-frame The shield-shaped yellowish-green, very fragrant red lids of the red-loving plant in May, although it can live in partial shade in the absence of the sun GREAVE. Even on heavy clay soils, although it prefers fertile, quite moistened loose soils, maple can take out dry soil, but it grows better when watering is well respected by feeding winter hardiness is high in harsh winters and when planting in places with strong winds, freezing of shoots is possible, especially in young plants; With age, winter hardiness increases 5 (up to -29 s) it is advisable in the fall to collect and burn fallen leaves to plant in places where there is a good Air circulation, otherwise, can be affected by powdery mildew, the Ostrient Crimson Sentry can be affected by a slender tree with a high density of the crown. The branches of the plants are directed up, and purple leaves decorate it all year round. Culture branches are characterized by a small length, density, they grow from the lowest part of the barrel. Often you can find specimens that are vaccinated on the stem, this is why the characteristics of the maple depend. Land the sprout In open ground, it is better in the first spring weeks or in the autumn. When choosing a site, it is worth considering that the distance between the seedlings of this culture should be 250-300 cm. The best choice will be a lit or a shaded place with a well -drained substrate. The depth of the pit must correspond to the size of the root coma of the seedling, and the shirin is 4 times larger than it. The vaccinated “Crimson Sentry” in the first days after planting should be well watered. When the tree becomes strong and Adults, irrigation should not be stopped. In spring and autumn, the procedure is carried out once a month, and in the summer - once a week. The young representative of the flora should have enough 40 liters of water at a time, and an adult - 20 liters less. After irrigation of the maple, you need to engage in the loosening of its trunk circle, as well as the removal of weeds. The oxide maple can be propagated in three ways.\n\n\n\tSeeds. With the help of seed material, Crimson Sentry propagates quite simply. For this, seeds are sown in the beds in the fall, So that they are subjected to natural stratification. In the spring, gardeners will already have the opportunity to see the shoots and plant them. Like any other representative of Flora, Crimson Sentry can suffer from infectious ailments and parasites. When the leaves dry in the tree, the leaves turn green and the stems damp, it looks weak and lags behind in growth, then the gardener should think about the treatment of culture. Quite often, oxide maple is attacked by coral spotting. This ailment is manifested in the death branches, as well as the formation of small spots on burgundy on the bark.|||Acer Mandshuricum is well suited for both solitarian and group plantings tall 10-20 slowly growing tree round, reddish-brown, bare strong diameter up to 60 cm gray or brownish, fine-bore lanceolate, ovoid or oblong-ellipsoidal 8 x 2.5 x 2.5.

It does not tolerate the urban environment with a high manchu maple - a unique tree, a unique tree. This is due to an unusual color and growth features. In spring and summer, the color of the leaves of Manchu maple does not differ from the color of the foliage of most trees. At this time The color scheme varies within yellow-green shades.\n\nWith the onset of autumn, everything changes dramatically, and the tree becomes yellow-pink. Three -syllable leaves elongated in length are placed on red petioles. They reach 8 cm in length and 2.5 cm in width. A distinctive feature is the color of the barrel, fluctuating from gray to brown. An adult tree is not a particularly whimsical culture, it can withstand both a lack of moisture and a strong gusty wind. You can't say that About the tree growing at home, which is most difficult to adapt to the urban environment for the first three years. The young root system is extremely sensitive to soil and pests. For this reason, it is better to buy a seedling in nurseries, where they are hardened to some extent. In addition, seedlings from nurseries are properly vaccinated, which will allow a tree to grow faster and accelerate the flowering process.\n\nSpring and autumn are considered favorable seasons for planting. When choosing time, it is best to push off from climatic conditions of the region. If the cold occurs quickly, then it is better to plan a seedling plant in open ground in the spring. First of all, care implies regular watering. During the first month after planting, it is necessary to nourish the maple of two buckets of water once a week. In the spring-autumn period, it is necessary to water the tree once every 2 weeks, due to a small number of warm days. In the summer, watering is carried out once a week. In heat weather, the volume of water is increased to 2 buckets per week. The tree propagates in several ways. The simplest are the germination of seeds and the rooting of cuttings. The first method is within the power of experienced gardeners, since it requires certain experience and dexterity. With an experimental approach to business, only about 30% of the seeds collected in the summer is rooted. And this is provided that they are treated with 0.01%concentrate of hydrogen peroxide. Processing is carried out within 16 hours. The preparation of the seeds does not end there. It will be necessary to take care of the shelter sprouted seedlings for the winter.\n\nIf the seeds were collected under a tree, then before soaking you need to harden them. To do this, they are placed for 3 months in a container with sand, which all this time is stored in the refrigerator. Most often it affects the foliage of the tree mol. Brown spots on the sheets, inside of which holes are visible, speak of its presence. This suggests that the insect has fired foliage.\n\nIf brown spots do not have holes, then this is a sign of rot. In cases with the advent of moths effective The remedy will be irrigation of the tree “Fufanon” and “Fitoverm”. From the fungus, you can be saved by \"Fundazole\", \"Hom\" or a 1%solution of Bordeaux fluid.|||Royal Red Ostrifice is used for landing in parks and alleys, to create color compositions tall up to 20 to 8 grows quickly about 40 cm, dense pyramidal stitching trunk is covered with a gray-brown dark bark, the bark of young branches is quite smooth and carries an attractive red-gray, large red red red-red red-red red-red red-orange shade or yellow no no, and the yellowish-green period of flowering begins in May until the leaves bloom, and It ends after the leaves are completely bloated by the holes, brownish yellow sunny, it will goodly tolerates the shadow requires moist and fertile soils, the slightly acidic responds well to top dressing in the pruning, only the sanitary with the mandatory processing of the wounds does not tolerate the drought as a whole, in harsh winter, at a young age, freezing of the shoots and the formation of frost-bearing frauds are possible The USD 4 zone is recommended preventive treatment against powdery mildew in the general The characterization of maples is represented by approximately 150 varieties growing in moderate areas. They grow in the form of trees or bushes with simple, and sometimes complicated, longed chattering sheets, very original, bright-chilled in the autumn season, and fruits-wingeds.\n\nMost species are used as decorative elements that differ in elegant drawings and unusual leaves of leaves. Most of the forms of maple is winter -hardy, have a good A shooting ability, well stores a typical form for their type. They are recommended both with one -time landings on lawns and to form contrasting effects in groups.\n\nPlants are usually planted in open meadows or in semi -toned conditions. It is important to remember that trees that have a certain decorative color of the leaves, when growing in shaded conditions, can lose it.\n\nThe root neck is usually located no deeper than soil level. Maple is extremely popular in landscape design For solitary, alley landing in ordinary and group forms, for the formation of contrasting and seasonal compositions. The maple is decorative for a full period of development. But especially in the spring, when the color of the foliage comes into contrast with yellowish flowers, the original decorative effect of the plant is perfectly felt.\n\nThe tree quickly adapts to the city conditions, the gasket of the air of its streets. The plant is very popular in our cities, it is considered one of the main rocks used in landscaping:\n\n\n\t\n\tresidential buildings;\n\t\n\t\n\tsick leave;\n\t\n\t\n\teducational institutions;\n\t\n\t\n\tsmall courtyards and private territories;\n\t\n\t\n\tsummer cottages;\n\t\n\t\n\tcity ​​streets, Bulvarov and alleys;\n\t\n\t\n\tSquares and park zones."

The Kotovnik Fassen is also unpretentious in leaving the people is also known as cat mint. This is justified by the fact that the aroma of the plant really likes cats. He acts on them in the same way as valerian.\n\nThis type of flower was bred as a result of crossing two other types of catnip. The hybrid took them all the best from them. The plant is characterized by good winter hardiness. Therefore, it can Grow even in cold or arid regions. Over the past few years, many varieties of this plant have been withdrawn. The most popular are the following of them.\n\n\n\t \"Selected blue\" (Select Blue). This Kotovnik variety is characterized by large buds. The shade of inflorescences is blue-lilac. They retain their attractiveness throughout the summer season. An unpretentious plant can be grown in most areas. But if the gardener wants to achieve magnificent flowering of bushes, they should be planted on Sunny place. The soil on the site should be light and dry. If water is constantly stagnant on the flowerbed, the roots of the plants can be bent. Tomatoes and cucumbers will become good predecessors for the kotovnik.\n\nThe site before planting the catnip must be digested and cleaned of weeds. In the soil, you need to close it with humus or compost. This will significantly improve the appearance of plants. The gardener will not have to spend a lot of time to care for this flower. Kotovnik agricultural technology consists of the following events.\n\n\n\tWatering. The plant easily tolerates the effects of high temperatures. The flower does not need regular watering. Therefore, irrigating the earth next to the bush is worth only during a protracted heat. In other cases, severe soil hydration can lead to the death of the flower. For watering flowers, you should use warm defended water. It is better to water flowers in the early morning or late in the evening. Water must be poured under the root, trying not to touch the foliage.\n\tLoosening. After rain or watering, soil next to Supply of plants can be covered with a dense crust. Therefore, from time to time, the soil needs to be loosened. Thanks to this procedure, moisture and nutrients will quickly go to plant roots. During loosening, the site is important to clean from weeds. They are usually sent to a compost pile or used to mulch the site.\n\tTop dressing. In general, a herbaceous plant does not need any additional top dressing. It can react to fertilizers negatively. Therefore, to make them in The soil is only if the land on the site is too poor. Then, after the first flowering or trimming of the plant, you can feed with complex mineral fertilizer or a chicken infusion. In this case, the bush will be more magnificent next time. Flower top dressing is usually combined with their watering.\n\tCutting. In summer, plants need pruning. The kotovnik grows very quickly. Therefore, if you ignore this procedure, the flower will look sloppy. After the end of flowering The shoots are also cut. This helps the plant survive the winter without any problems. In addition, in this case, the kotovnik will not multiply by self -sowing. Before trimming, garden tools must be disinfected-otherwise there is a risk of infecting flowers with any disease. The cut parts of the plant is not necessary to throw away. If there is a need to propagate a catnip, green shoots can be used as planting material. Some gardeners dry them, put them in paper Packages are used as a seasoning or aromatic additive to tea. You can store a dried kotovnik for 1.5-2 years.\n\tTransfer. So that the perennial kotovnik always looks beautiful, every 4-5 years he is transplanted. This helps to quickly rejuvenate the bush. The transplant of the flower is quite simple. The plant must be gently digging up, while trying not to damage its roots. Next, the site on which the flower will be planted is required to dig a well. The soil should be loose and light. On the chosen A place needs to dig a few holes. They place flowers in them. Next, their roots are gently sprinkled with the soil. The earth is neatly tamped and watered with warm water. A transplanted plant takes root quickly enough. Propagating the kotovnik at home is very simple. Do this in four main ways. The plant is good resistance to most common diseases. The danger to him is only powdery mildew, which develops in conditions of increased moisture. Careless plants are treated with fungicides. If they do not help, damaged bushes dig and destroy. This is done in order to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nThe danger for plants is also pose insects. As a rule, the bushes attack whiteflies and ticks. To combat them, you can use any proven insecticides. The invasions of aphids and bugs can not be afraid - the saturated fragrance of the kotnik scares away these pests. High catners look great on Alpine slides and in mixborders. Usually they are planted in the center of the flowerbed, surrounding in lower colors. Good companions for this flower will be phloxes, different types of geranium or tansy."

This variety was obtained thanks to the hybridization of the Lilyi Magnolia. The lifetime of culture sometimes reaches 50 years, but only with content in favorable conditions. The pyramidal crown over time is slightly rounded. It is formed by thick leaf plates of juicy Green with glossy shine.\n\nFlowering of hybrid magnolia starts in April-May, and can continue until the end of the first summer month. Inflorescences with their appearance are slightly reminiscent of large glasses, looking up. The diameter of one flower with six petals can be 15 cm. Light pink buds have a bright and very pleasant aroma. The planting of magnolia of the hybrid variety \"Susan\" is more correct to carry out in the middle of autumn. This is explained by the fact that the tree is somewhere in October He hibernates, and therefore much easier to tolerates all traumatic procedures. In principle, the culture can be planted in the spring, but it is worth being prepared for the fact that sudden frosts will destroy the plant. A planted or transplanted tree always hides tightly, since low temperatures are destructive for it. The soil where magnolia will be located should be enriched with peat, chernozem and compost. Culture does not like lime or sandy areas. The cultivation of capricious culture has its specifics. For example, it is extremely important that the acidity of the soil remains either high or medium, otherwise the culture will get sick. In addition, the high nitrogeniness of the soil leads to the fact that the frost resistance of Susan is falling. Susan hybrid magnolia can be propagated using three basic methods: seeds, layering and cuttings. The seed method is suitable only for warm regions, since even if you have a high -quality shelter, the Cold season does not survive the material of the material. Propagation Seeds are quite troublesome. They will have to be planted immediately after the collection, not forgetting to first pierce with a needle or rub the too hard shell with sandpaper. And also the planting material will need to be washed with soapy water from the oily layer and rinsed in clean water.\n\nFor planting, ordinary wooden boxes filled with nutrient soil will be required. Each seed will need to deepen into the ground somewhere by 3 centimeters. Planted seeds are cleaned in a cold place, for example, in The basement, where they are left almost until March. In the spring, the boxes will need to be extracted and placed on a fairly illuminated surface, ideally on the windowsill. Of the pests of the susan magnolia, powdery marthes and spider mites are most often attacking. Quite often, damage to rodents are also found. Getting rid of insects occurs using insecticides, for example, acaricides. Timely mulching will help from the effects of mice attacking the trunk and roots of wood. If everything is rodent It was possible to break through, the damaged place should be treated with a solution of Fundazole. Magnolia “Susan” can be planted as a single shrub, and can become part of the designer group, located in the forefront or middle plan. It is customary to combine it with cultures such as thuja, linden, viburnum and juniper. The combination of magnolia and blue spruce looks extremely advantageous.

Occupational options are also capable of Grow to such a height, but in most cases they have much more miniature sizes. White -filled milk has a surface root system, like many other plants growing on sandy and rocky soils. For this reason, containers for such plants are preferable to choose not very deep, but quite wide. Otherwise, water will stagnate at the bottom, which does not like this unusual green “pet” at all. Belozhny Mulch - A rather large photophilous plant. It needs a prolonged light bottom (up to 12 hours). The light should be bright, but scattered, since scorching rays can lead to a burn of leaf plates. If the succulent is placed in a darkened place, then it gradually stops forming new leaves and increasing its green mass. If young leaves grow occasionally, then they are very small and weak. If there was no other place for the plant, and you planted milk in Fectum, from time to time, turn it so that the sun's rays touch all sides of the plant. Many flower breeders are worried about the question of milk pruning. The fact is that it looks like a decorative palm, so some inexperienced plant owners think that when pruning they will destroy an exotic top. This is wrong. Timely pruning contributes to the increase and formation of green mass. However, the procedure must be carried out correctly and accurately, using a scalpel or very good A sharpened knife. The cut shoots can subsequently be rooted (this will be described later). Propagate milk in a vegetative way - seeds or cuttings. Propagation of cuttings is one of the most common methods. This procedure is carried out in late spring - early summer. To do this, cut off shoots 4-6 cm long and immediately place them in a vessel with water (it must certainly be clean, soft and warm). After a couple of days, the release of the juice stops. Then You can remove the cuttings and treat the cut place with coal - this will help prevent the penetration of pathogenic microflora. Then you need to prepare the soil mixture, form a small depression, plant a stalk, sprinkle with earth and water a little. The soil must be tamped so that the stalk is placed in the center of the container. In the first 3 weeks, a young sprout should be disturbed as little as possible, since the plant already experiences stress, so any deviation from the usual conditions Only worsens the situation. Often, novice flower growers do not understand why the flower wound, lowered the leaves or began to lose them. We will figure out what should be done in such a situation.

The opening area is expressed in the form of a ball, the color of the fetus is from pale lemon to the color of the juicy olive. The shrub blooms twice a year - in June and early August. If spring began early, and warming came at the end of April, then in May you can observe a blooming spurge. It adapts on any soil of Eurasia. You can meet it along the roads, on rocky surfaces and even on dumps with garbage. Polchikha is a multi -faced plant. More than 1000 species were detected by botanists. Therefore, its diversity is endless. It can be a picturesque medium -sized shrub or a grassy group. It has various dimensions and color parameters. Cyparis's milk in the choice of soil is low. It can be the soil of medium lightness, chernozem, crushed stone. If possible You can add peat or compost. In this case, the approach to landing will be more complete. In order for the Earth to be unlawed, it is worth reducing the distance from the reservoir, natural or artificial. Though they will be better and unpretentious, it will be better if you choose a place where there is more sun than shadows for its planting. With good lighting, the bush will be more beautiful, and the flowering period will last. In a dark place, milk can also live, but the stems will be thin and unattractive. And the flowers may not at all Blossom. The plant will not be fluffy, thereby losing the property of the decor. It is advisable to limit the landing territory into the framework, prevent it from growing, where and where it will have to. This will allow you to take shape during growth, the bush will become neat and bright.

An ancient legend says that a crown, dressed on the head of Jesus Christ, was made from this plant. In natural conditions, it grows in the form of a bush with a gray, slightly ribbed stem. Plant height Reaches two meters. Young elliptical leaves are born on the tops of shoots. For each leaf, there are two bracts, which over time are converted into very sharp thorns. During growing up, plants fall, only thorns remain. Outwardly, it looks a bare stem, dotted with spikes, and only at the top are islands of pale green shiny leaves. In Russia, europhia is grown as an indoor plant in apartments, private houses, greenhouses or year -round heated greenhouses. In such conditions, the flower is not able to reach its natural two -meter growth, as it grows very slowly, adding only a couple of centimeters annually in growth. It is relatively unpretentious, but very decorative due to flowering. Group inflorescences of four colors crown all the tops of the plant and blazing bright red, delightful shades. Even for such an unpretentious flower as milk mile, compliance is required certain conditions for landing and transplantation. This deserted plant hardly extracts moisture in a hot, arid climate, so its root system looks like an oblong rod with branched small roots. Therefore, for him the most comfortable will serve as a tall, narrowed pot. For the prevention of staging water and rotting of the roots, the planting container is filled with expanded clay. It can be replaced with damp pebbles or finely broken brick. Then the pot is filled with soil, which can be dialing in the garden area. For milk Mile, it is necessary to follow several rules for home care. All succulents are drought tolerant, which means that abundant watering is not required for them, but it depends on the time of year. In summer, two times a week is enough, in winter the watering is more rare-2-4 times a month as the upper layer of soil divers. For milk, the main rule is better to pour less than pouring. Because waterlogging leads to rotting of the roots system and the plant Dies. Pruning is carried out at any time of the year, except for the autumn period. This can be done periodically, as soon as you decide that they grew up and its “hair” is time to put in order. To form a beautiful lush crown, it is necessary: ​​in young shoots, pinch off the top of the shoot at an altitude of 10-15 centimeters; it is necessary to correctly cut the side buds-they are removed so that the new sprouts take a horizontal position; the central stem of an adult plant is cut off when it reaches The height necessary for you; you can accelerate the process of the appearance of new shoots by increasing lighting. The easiest way to propagate euphorbia is to divide the bush into several parts. In early spring, you need to get the plant from the container, slightly shake over the film. Then with your hands, very carefully, pull the lump of the earth along with the roots in different directions. The bush is divided, as a rule, into 2-3 parts. Cutting items are desirable not to use. If the bush is not divided without them, then a knife or scalpel It is necessary to pre -sterilize. Rinse fresh slices with water so that the juice stops faster, and sprinkle with ash. In prepared pots to plant updated bushes according to all the transplant rules. Since milk is stressful in this procedure, the first year it grows much slower and is very rare. Miles Mile usually “love” such harmful insects as aphids, whiteflies and a powdery worm.|||Euphorbia marginata in the wild grow in North America a bordered look (euphorbia marginate, rich bride) decorative planting euphoria most often in the background of mixborders, a mid-rostrum is a medium-sized there is 60-80 straight lush, thickly covered with leaves and oval up to 4 light green, in the summer in the summer The edges of the apical leaves become silver-white white, green, silver there is no yes small white June, July, August, September Nonfective Garden, room in open The soil is planted in early June, when the danger of return frosts of the plants is planted with a distance of 25-30 cm for growing in the garden, warm, sunny places, protected from the winds, are suitable both meager rocky and sandy substrates (although, of course, on fertile and loose soil it feels much more comfortable) the plant relieves the drying and does not suffer the drying and not It needs frequent watering by young plants 2-3 times fed with complex fertilizers with seeds, Milky juice is indignant in caring in care and can significantly burn the skin, therefore, when working with it, you must definitely use garden gloves, bastard - a poisonous plant, the milky juice of which contains euros.

A distinctive feature is the presence of a white border on the leaves.\n\nAn annual plant has straight stems up to 85 cm high with pale green leaves. The shape of the leaves can be both round and pointed. Inflorescences are small and white. The flowering period lasts from mid -summer until the beginning of winter. For planting plants in open ground, gardeners recommend using seedlings grown at home. In mid -May, strong and healthy seedlings from containers can Plant to the sunny areas of the garden. The optimal distance between landing pits is 35 cm. Specialists do not recommend planting the plant in wet and swampy areas. Basic rules and features of planting seedlings in open ground:\n\n\n\tcomplete cleaning of the site from debris and weeds;\n\tthe formation of planting pits at a distance of more than 30 cm from the edge of the flowerbed;\n\tjoint planting of plants only with the same root system;\n\tTo protect the flower composition from dust and dirt is advisable Snow balls to plant from the side of the road;\n\tsunlight is the key to abundant and beautiful flowering;\n\tmoisturizing the soil only by watering under the root;\n\tThe most favorable zone for growth is the southern and eastern part of the personal plot;\n\tBefore the onset of frosts, it is necessary to cut the upper shoots and remove the entire root system;\n\tCarrying is permissible only in the evening hours;\n\tTo obtain young plants from seeds, you need to hide the flowerbed in the spring and moisturize the soil. Evil -bordered - An unpretentious plant, the cultivation of which will not cause difficulties even in novice flower growers. The flower can be planted both in open ground and flower pots. Water the flower should be moderately and regularly. The plant easily tolerates drought and negatively refers to swampy soils. In the summer, it is enough to moisturize the ground once a week. When growing a flower at home, watering is carried out only after the soil dries completely. Experts do not recommend spraying milk.\n\nFor Planting a flower must be chosen a sunny and warm place. In the room, the optimal growth temperature should be in the range from +22 to + 24 degrees. An unpretentious plant can grow on a area with a high content of sand and gravel, but prefers nutritious earthen mixtures. Botanics recommend using loose, nutritious and fertile soil with low acidity for planting. Propagation of the plant is carried out in a seed method and cuttings. Seeds for planting can be purchased In specialized stores or assemble independently. After flowering, a small box with three seeds is formed on the plant. After fully ripening the seed box, it is necessary to disrupt it and remove the seed material.\n\nIn the period from February to April, seeds can be planted in prepared containers with nutrient soil. The height of the planting container should not exceed 120 mm. Before the seeding of seed material in the ground, you need to soak it for 2-3 hours in warm water.\n\nPrepared seeds They are laid out on the soil surface and moistened with a spray gun. The surface of the pot should be sprinkled with a mixture of peat and sand and covered with plastic film. The most comfortable germination temperature is + 18 degrees. The plant is not only unpretentious, but also resistant to various diseases. Beginning gardeners must take into account the fact that improper care can provoke the development of fungal diseases that are treated using special chemicals drugs. In the case of improper watering, low levels of illumination, the presence of drafts and a lack of nutrients in the plant, the leaves begin to turn yellow and fall off, and the root system also rotates. The following types of insects can cause harm to the plant and provoke its death:\n\n\n\tspider mite - the appearance of light plaque on the inside of the sheet and white hairs on the surface of the entire plant;\n\tThe powdery worm - the appearance on the leaves of white plaque;\n\tShield - Availability on sheet a plate of brown and white spots;\n\tTrips - the appearance of white spots on the leaves and the surface of the soil;\n\taphid - the presence of small larvae on all parts of the plant;\n\tBelkolka - the appearance of yellow and white spots on the sheet and its subsequent twisting;\n\tThe root worm - wilting the flower. Polchka is a popular plant in the decorative design of parks, alleys and flower beds. Its unpretentiousness and undemanding to watering and soil quality allow you to plant plants in the most remote corners of the personal plot. The white ball can be used not only as an independent plant, but also in the form of a decorative background in floral arrangements.\n\n\n\tDesigners are planted with phloxes, monartes, all types of cereals and bosulniki.|||Fisher’s milk, Euphorbia fischeriana, Molchochki Komarova is found in Transbaikalia (Chita and Amur Regions), Mongolia, China and Korea Pallas Type Drug Londer, Low-Rotten Nut-Rotten 7-20 (30) cm high, with a height of 2–5.5 (6) cm long, generative and generative and generative, generative and generative, generative and generative, generative and generative, generative and generative, general vegetative, simple; non -flowering often higher pubescent, less often naked and stem, except for the next lower ones, from a rounded or rarely slightly narrowed base, oblong or elliptical or oblong-lanceolate, dumb, bent lower leaves to 1 along the edge, stem-4-5.8 (7.3) stem-1.2–2.8 lower leaves are scaly; The stem leaves, except for the next lower, muttering, 5 or rarely 4 brown or brownish-green green, brown is not very thickened, branched, juicy, yellowish and 0.4-0.5 wide-shaped tops in the number of 5, naked or more or less dense, 2-7.5 cm long, with the fruits of little. lengthening, at the end of three-part, and then biased, subsequently more or less outstretched three-deck, 6-7 mm long, 7-8 mm wide, often more or less cilia about 3 mm long, 3.5-4 mm wide, egg-shaped, brown, with a disc shaft, Pallas’s milky, it belongs to perennial grassy plants, it belongs to it. Pretty rare. For its healing features and the unusual structure of the root, the people awarded the flower with many names: “man-grass”; “man-root”; “Light”; “Sunwith”; “Damn milk\". Although Pallas’s milk is attributed to endemic, it can be cultivated at home: like a indoor plant or on a site. In essence, it is little -related and unpretentious in care. For a good growth, he needs a little. Substrat should be sandy-friva with the addition of turf and deciduous land. The presence of a small number of stones in the ground is also extremely desirable. It should be as similar as possible to natural soil in which milk in nature grows. The capacity Deep, but not very wide for growing is suitable. The potato pots will be an ideal solution. The growth is not too photophilous, so it needs to be protected from direct sunlight. In the summer, you can plant it in open soil, but the place for landing should be shaded and not too hot. The suitable temperature is from +17 to +20 degrees. The watering of watering depends on the time of year. In the spring and autumn, the plant is moistened once every two weeks, in the summer they are watered once A week, and in winter watering is reduced to once a month. For growth and development, milking is needed fertilizers. You can use feeding for cacti. It is introduced once every two weeks, except for the winter season, during this period the plant does not need to be fertilized. Pallas's milk is propagated, like most indoor plants, in several ways: stem cuttings; leaves. The way of breeding has its own nuances, observing which, you can plant the plant without much difficulties. The first method They use in the spring when the flower is in the stage of active growth: from the upper part of the milk, small cuttings are pinned about 12 cm in length; the segments are immersed in dishes with warm water so that the cuts are treated with crushed coal; after the appearance of the protective film in the damaged place, the stalk is moistened or sprinkled with a growth stimulant, for example, “root”, and planted in a “root” and planted in Sand-fruit substrate. Despite the release of harmful juice, the flower may be attacked by pests, Plant diseases are directly related to improper care of it. If the plant loses the leaves, but not affected by pests, there is a likelihood of drafts or sharp temperature changes. In this case, it is necessary to pick up the flower from the windowsill and control the temperature regime. In the event of an unpleasant odor and falling out of the foliage, it is necessary to establish an irrigation system, since these are signs of root rot. The exposure of dry brown spots indicate a natural aging process milking. If the plant is young, it marks the penetration of direct sunlight. It is necessary to rearrange the flower in a less lit place or shade a little. When drying the ends of the shoots, it is worth increasing the humidity in the room. Poles are subjected to regular spraying and increase the humidity of the room. A soot fungus manifests itself with a black raid on sheet plates, as well as a consequence of the life of aphids or whiteflies. As a result of the disease, the plant weakens and huddles. Mo can get rid of pests, and the fungus is washed off with a soap solution."

The plant is not demanding on soils, but you should choose soils with the presence of lime. Dual monard (lat. Monarda DIDYMA) is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the family of clearly. For the first time, the plant was noticed on the territory of North America, where it was called Indian nettle. Then it was widespread in Europe and Asia. The monard is called a garden bergamot because of the similarity of aromas. It is red, pink, purple, purple. In Europe and America, work is being carried out to remove new decorative varieties of a dual monard. The breeding work led to the emergence of new varieties of this species. Independently dispersed the monard on the garden plot enough Just. The plant is grown as a vegetative way - cutting and dividing the bush, also grown using seeds and seedlings.\n\nPropagation with seedlings:\n\n\n\t\n\tSow seeds in greenhouses in February-March to a depth of 0.5-1 cm in a prepared container;\n\t\n\t\n\tcover with a film, leaving a hole for air flow;\n\t\n\t\n\tThe temperature of the content should be not lower than 20 ° C;\n\t\n\t\n\tsprouts sprout after 15-20 days;\n\t\n\t\n\tWhen three pairs of leaves appear, picking seedlings are carried out;\n\t\n\t\n\tseedlings in May are planted in open soil at a distance of 50 cm;\n\t\n\t\n\tmake abundant watering;\n\t\n\t\n\tseedlings tolerates frosts to –5 ° C;\n\t\n\t\n\tIn this method, flowering begins this year. The monard is famous for its good health, resistant to diseases and pests. The aroma of the plant scares away most insects. However, there are times when the bush can be attacked by pests or disease. In most cases, this occurs with improper care of the plant.|||Monarda Citriodora Lemonnoye (Citroder) Decorative, Perennial spice, Annual, Annemar Perennial High-Race Plant 15-80 (up to 150) Langeut and characteristic small pink, purple June, July, August, September, inflorescences consist of a medium-illuminated dry sandy soil, abundant, abundant, abundant, abundant, abundant, abundant. 2-3 times a week only during the period of active growth by seeds collected for seedlings in early April, does not need special requirements for growth and flowering, we need moderate humidity Air Culture is a fast-growing perennial failure, which grows up to 60-90 cm in length. It has odorous leaves, when rubbing, they exude the aroma of lemon. If the foliage is already old, then it still remains fragrant, however, in this period the smell is more reminiscent of Oregano than citrus. By the way, this aroma is considered attractive to bees and butterflies, so the garden in which the monard is planted is always filled with a summer mood.\n\nIn shape the leaves are oval, pointed, in length They reach 3-8 cm. Around the stems growing from the center of the bush, flowers of white, pink or purple color curl. Flowering continues from June to September with pretty multi -level inflorescences. In nature, culture is widespread in the USA, where it can be found on the sidelines of roads. The plant grows well in local clay soil and sometimes a whole carpet of bright flowers decorates American meadows. The culture was well adapted to life in Russian gardens. The most common varieties in Russia is Mona Lisa, Diana, Solntsevsky Semko. These are annual varieties, which, however, can withstand winter cold. This plant tolerates lime or alkaline soils well, but it is important to avoid areas that can be flooded. For planting, choose a sunny place. The plants themselves can be placed close to a friend, about 30-40 cm: this is how a more picturesque appearance of the flower bed will create, but between the rows it is better to observe a distance of at least 70 cm. If The gardener is trying to create a flower arrangement, it is recommended to leave about 40-50 cm from other landings. Seedlings are planted in separate holes, plentifully soaked in water. After planting the bush, it is immediately required to water well, and then irrigate several times with an interval of 2-3 days. Further, the culture is practically not needed, only in the dry period if it coincides with the flowering period.\n\nThe rest of the time, the culture will suffer well and drought. However, in the case when the plant is planted for decorative goals, it is still better to water it along with neighboring cultures, because then the inflorescences will develop more magnificent, and the risk of damage to the plant with powdery mildew will be reduced. When growing on poor soil, top dressing should be started in the first year. The first fertilizer is made in early spring or a month after planting. Complex mineral compositions are suitable as additional power during this period. The second time the plant is fed after flowering. In this case Sulfate and potassium mixtures will be relevant, which will improve the ripening and laying of the kidneys for the next year. The culture is customary to breed the bush or cultivation from the seeds. In the first case, four -year bushes are used. This is not the most popular and productive method of reproduction, so let's dwell on seed breeding in more detail. Sowing is carried out in January or February. Planting material is deepened into the substrate into containers, the first shoots can be interpreted in three weeks.\n\nYoung Bushes will feel comfortable at a temperature of about +20 degrees. Snoes aged 2-2.5 months can be transplanted into open ground. Before planting, dig the bed, introduce manure, minerals, sand, lime, and add ammonia nitrate directly at the planting stage of seedlings."

Her homeland is the tropical forests of South America, more than Part grows in Brazil. Range is considered a perennial. Its height reaches 25-30 meters. The stems are very large, fleshy, covered with many short -term leaflets. They, in turn, have a round -oval shape. The right plate is smooth, a light gloss is noticeable. The diameter of the leaves is about 5 cm. They are painted green, the shade changes from monochrome light to dark. This variety of peperomy is unpretentious. Growing at home requires compliance with several simple The rules that will help to contain a flower in good condition. Excuse flower growers advise after buying a young seedling to carefully inspect his roots. Having planted the plant in a pot, it is recommended to follow its condition. So, if the roots are not visible from under the drainage coating-further transplanting to another container is not required. In general, peperomy prefers a constant place of growth. Frequent transplants painfully affect the condition of its root system. Flower breeders do not recommend Put pots on a heavily lit window sill - from constant straight sunlight, the leaves brighten. Therefore, the ideal condition for the content of the flower will be multiple light. In addition, peperomy demonstrates good results under the influence of artificial lighting, for example, phytolamps, as well as an ordinary indoor. Peperomy is magnolisy - a heat -loving plant. The optimal temperature regime of its content is 20–25 degrees. Drafts and harsh differences are painful affect the general condition, sometimes lead to disease. It is important to maintain heat during the year, since this variety does not have rest. For the same reason, it is not recommended to grow peperomy on the north side - the lack of light will lead to a loss of a decorative type of young shoots, they will become elongated and completely unattractive. Peperomy of the magnolisite is able to transfer short -term overdrying of the soil, but excess moisture of the plant will not benefit the plant. The reason is that Powerful stems and leaflets have the ability to accumulate water in order to spend it if necessary. It is especially dangerous for waterlogging of the Earth at low air temperature - the root system is subject to decay. So moderate watering should be carried out in the summer, closer to winter - slightly less often. It is very easy to dry the tropical flower, especially with the start of the heating season. In the cold months, it is recommended to carry out regular spraying with water - this is the most effective protection against overdrying the roots, foliage. IN The rest of the time, such manipulations are not required. Experienced flower growers advise for the duration of the heating season to put a pot on a tray with a expanded clay layer. He, in turn, must be constantly moistened. Do not let the bottom of the container come into contact with water - so you will not protect the roots from waterlogging. The flower planted in fresh soil does not require too frequent top dressing. For saturation with useful elements, the plant is fertilized once every three weeks. In this case, it is recommended to pay half the dose fertilizers. Growing a beautiful magnificent bush at home is quite simple - the main thing is sometimes to pinch the stems. And this also leads to the formation of lateral shoots that affect the decorative appearance of the flower. In the same case, do not forget about the tops: as soon as the lower leaves were dropped, you need to shorten the upper part of the shoots. For planting, shallow containers with a drainage layer at the bottom are used - this has a beneficial effect on strengthening small, weak roots. By the rules, young peperomy He experiences a transplant annually, however, the dishes are chosen 4 cm more than the previous one. The transplants of an adult flower (after reaching 3 years) are reduced - the procedure is carried out once every two years. As for the old specimens, they are transplanted in rare cases: if, for example, the roots seemed from drainage holes. High -quality soil is necessary for the full -fledged growth of peperomy: it should be loose, with a high level of fertility. Too heavy soil threatens with rotting of the root system. The stock of useful trace elements can be added by the addition of mineral components. Experienced flower growers prepare their own planting mixture: from sand, leafy, humus, peat. In addition to standard care procedures, indoor plant needs prevention against diseases and harmful insects. Most of them, by the way, appear as a result of improper content. Problems with foliage: they darken (the reason is a sharp decrease in temperature); rapidly fall (lack of moisture, more often Due to the content of the pot near the battery turned on); they become lethargic (the process of rotting of the roots or the development of the fungus as a result of frequent irrigation); wrinkle (direct sunlight)."

The rosette of the plant is formed at the root, from there, large elongated green leaves with small villi on them grow from there. The primrose does not really like too bright light, slightly A shaded place for her is best. The plant prefers fresh air, so in the warm season it can be taken out onto the balcony or on the street when living in a private house. Akaulis primrose can be propagated in several ways: if you adhere to the main recommendations for growing a primrose, then the plant should not get sick. As for insects, they often fly from other sick plants, which is why processing should be carried out as thoroughly as possible.|||The primrose is shallow, gear-toed gimalayas, mountains of Southeast Asia and Afghanistan, China (Sichuan, Yunnan) and Indochina (Burma), Indian subcontinent (India: Arunal-Pradesh, Himala-Pradesh, Jamma and Kashmir, Uttar-Predash; Sickoy, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal, Nepal. Pakistan) Type of fine-toothed slaves, flower beds, group planting medium-sized 20-40 20-30 simple, wide, oblong-oval or vice versa, first from 3 to 15 cm and grows to 20–40 cm in fruiting stage, the edge is jagged Green is low-fried or naked, with a height of 5 to 30 cm during flowering and lengthen up to 45 cm to the maturity of fruits small 1.5 purple, lilac, pink, purple, white with a yellow eye white, pink, purple simple April, May early 35-40 days. Once an indispensable condition for growing a primer is a soil-rich soil. It is best to collect soil for planting from rotten leaves, a sustained cow manure and home compost. In addition, primrose is very mulched chopped foliage. Organic substance helps not only retain moisture, but also prevent its evaporation. It is worth highlighting the main features of the shallow primrose. They include inflorescences that are formed in dense balls. There are many varieties of a small -tooth -to -type primrose. All of them differ in small flowers, which are collected on a long escape in a large hat. Seeds will help to quickly propagate the plant on their own flowerbed or in pots on the balcony. Easy should be used for sowing The soil, pots are small, only 10 centimeters in diameter, you can even less, and 5 centimeters in depth. This is one of the simplest secrets of growing young primrose from seeds, since it is inclined to die if it is subjected to too frequent watering.|||Infinite pereloric primrose in China is found in China the form of an oats (inveteral) perennial grassy plant medium-sized from 5 to 20 (rarely up to 25) from 1.5 to 14 cm long with white or yellow-brown multicellular hairs from an egg-shaped-round to an elliptic or elongated form from 3 to 14 cm from 2.5 to 11 cm Green from 5 to 20 mm are covered with fluffy hairs medium 1.5–2.5 from pink to lavender-pink, rarely white pink simple cups or broad -shaped, shortly pubescent or short -legged, consist of five cups, free up to 1/4–1/3 of the length of the cup of the cup once a garden, the balcony (terrace) prefers bright, but scattered lighting is a light, loose, well -drained soil with a neutral or slightly acid reaction, no overlapping, nor drying during the period it is recommended to feed active growth and flowering with complex mineral fertilizers for flowering plants with seeds and vegetatively - The division of the bush or rooting of cuttings is good unpretentious in leaving these days there are many traditional varieties of primrose, as well as large -flowered Dutch hybrids with various decorative properties. Primula ObConica primrose family of primary ones - one of these plants (other names of the Oakoniki primrose - inverse, vice versa). Suitable for growing in gardens and at home. The situation was \"saved\" by Dutch breeders. The modern ones they created Hybrids of primroses vocals practically do not distinguish the primine and are not allergens, which allows, if desired, without fears to grow these delicate touching plants to all lovers of room flora. Reproduction by seeds is considered the most effective way. The period from seed sowing to flowering is approximately 6 months. If you sow the seeds in January and properly care for crops, then in the middle of summer you can expect the first flowering of primrose. With a phased landing (every 4 weeks, from January), primrose will delight you with continuous flowering until April next year. The attitude to the nature of this beauty among flower growers is ambiguous-some consider her capricious, others unpretentious, and each of them is right in their own way. The novice flower breed plot will seem to be difficult, and an experienced florist with an impressive baggage of knowledge and experience will not be difficult. In general, agricultural equipment is simple. Here are the main elements of care for the room primrose of the Oakonnik in home conditions."

The unpretentious average June-July, the abundant rhododendron of Adams in Russia is also widely known as Sagan Dali or Sagan-Dail-as the Buryats call it, In the regions of compact residence of which it is traditionally growing. In terms of botanical classification, this shrub belongs to the genus Rhododendron. This plant looks like a very thick shrub with a height of no more than half a meter from the ground, but with an abundance of branches. A similar miracle grows usually in a mountainous and wooded area in the Far East and the surrounding territories of neighboring states. Adams's rhododendron can be grown both in open ground and in a pot, but in both cases it is necessary to create For him, those conditions in which he could gain a foothold in nature. So, Sagan-Daila does not like excessively bright lighting and lives in places where there are neither strong winds nor drafts. The bush should in no case be flooded with soil waters, so they try to plant it in an elevated place where moisture will not accumulate even after severe precipitation. Contrary to all of the above, a lack of moisture both in the ground and in the air for the plant is also destructive. As for the free Spaces, then Adams Rhododendron is not demanding - he does not need a lot of space. Since the natural conditions in the country in the suburbs and at home are very different from the highland forest, the cultivation of rhododendron involves certain difficulties. Even with strict observance of all recommendations, it is impossible to unequivocally say that everything will work out, but if you neglect at least some principles of care, then you will definitely not be able to grow a Sagan-Dali.\n\nUnlike many other garden plants, Regarding Adams's rhododendron, there is a very specific recommendation for the volume of irrigation - for 1 bush, 2 liters of water are usually required at a time. With the frequency, at the same time, you still have to determine by eye - you need to find the middle ground, when the earth would not dry out, and the water did not stagnate in the roots. In the hottest periods of the year, it is recommended to carry out regular spraying the plant, but such a need exists only as long as the bush grows. If you like difficulties, propagate this The bush can also be seeds, but get ready that the task is by no means a simple one. If you still decide, in March, plant the seeds in a wet mixture of sand and peat, which ideally should be placed in a constant container. After that, by covering the container with polyethylene, primitive greenhouse conditions are created, the container itself is sent to the window. It is necessary to ventilate the contents of the container every day, as well as water as the soil dries. Like most other species Living organisms, Rhododendron Adams have natural enemies from whom it needs to be protected. This bush was not very lucky, since it is interesting to many types of insects, and in each case you need to deal with them differently, given the specifics of the pest. If you see the discs well and you can collect them manually, it is best to do so, and Sagan-Dali himself is sprayed with insecticide to finish off the survivors. If the danger is identified as a bug or spider mite, the best means in the struggle “Diazin” can become with them, if the enemy is a weevil, then the same tool will have to spray the soil around the barrel. “Carbophos” is well suited to combat most other pests."

Each gardener sets The question of how to properly plant a mountain ash of Magnikh, \"Letestens\" or other varieties of this species, to take care of it. This topic began to be especially interested in landscape designers, which now more often use mountain ash to create original compositions. Detecting pests and diseases in mountain ash is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance. Especially carefully for the plant must be monitored in the spring-summer period, when insects and diseases are activated.\n\nTo prevent the appearance Dragged dew, as well as preserve the integrity of the tree, it is worth taking care of the preventive processing of the culture with special compounds. Insecticides or more sparing substances should be used in accordance with the instructions from the package. Aria is increasingly used in landscape design. The unique color of the leaves and large inflorescences are key characteristics of the plant, for which it is appreciated by specialists. Of course, you cannot leave the colorful fruits of the color of autumn foliage without attention. The tree is active Used to create single compositions, as well as group.|||In the 4th year, Sórbus Aucupária is almost all of Europe, the Caucasus, Front Asia; It reaches the Far North, and in the mountains it rises to the very border of vegetation, where the form of an ordinary universal group planting of compotes, jelly, jelly, high average growth of tall to 12 (usually 5-10) up to 5.5, rounded, smooth in adult trees, light-brown or yellow-gray, brilliant naked, reddish-red, reddish-brown, rises. covered with brilliant grayish color with a film, easy washing; Young shoots are grayish-red, lowered, felt, large, large to 20 lengths green golden, red elongated, pointed smooth tender teeth 0.8-1.5 white to 10 in May-during flowering, an unpleasant odor (the reason for this is the trimethylamine gas) large-red red red, orange medium juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy. sugar (up to 5 %), apple, citric, wine and amber acids (2.5 %), tannins (0.5 %) and pectin (0.5 %) substances early at the end of August -September Early Autumn or Late Spring, well-illuminated areas, well-illuminated areas grows perfectly on loams of moderate acidity, gray podzolic soils, soup, chernozems should only be watered in hot and dry weather, if there is no precipitation for more than 3 weeks can be fertilized once every 3-4 years, mulching the trunk circle and introducing a comprehensive mineral fertilizer one-time, in one-time, in one time. The mountain ash does not need the beginning of summer in the formative pruning, the sanitary haircut needs to be carried out early in the spring Cover the trunk circle of seedlings with a layer of mulch, a layer of 5-10 cm in the average average and highly unpretentious in leaving the botanical name for the ordinary-Sorbus aucuparia. It came from Celtic and means \"bitter and tart.\" But there are also references to the fact that the mountain ash is translated from the Latin language as “bird” and “catch”. In ancient times, it was the fruits of mountain ash that was used as a bait to catch birds. The tree belongs to the type of woodwood plants. In turn, this The genus refers to the pink family. Since the mountain ash is unpretentious to the soil, her habitat is extensive. Often a tree can be found in the Caucasian regions. In Russia, Ryababina, ordinary has a very large distribution area. It can be found on the edge of the forest or in the meadow (near the forest belts). At the same time, the tree loves space, so it is most often growing lonely. The most common varieties of mountain ash are the following varieties.\n\n\n\tBusinolite. Beautiful shrub whose height is It is 250 cm. The crown is not very thick, rounded or ovoid in shape. The stems are erect, dark brown, there is a blue plaque. Vesti bark is gray, has clearly distinguishable lentils. The leaves are unpaired, 18 cm long. In shape they are lanceolate. And also the composition includes from 7 to 15 small leaves of an oval shape of a dark green color. The inflorescences are complex, shield -shaped. Flowers with a diameter of not more than 15 mm. In color, they are pure white, or have a slight red spraying. Fruit Juicy and elastic, have a rich red color, spherical in shape. To taste sweet and sour. There is a variety in Kamchatka and in the Khabarovsk Territory, as well as in northern Japan. Before planting a seedling, you need to take care of the place of landing. Several factors should be taken into account. In relation to the light of the mountain ash, that is, it can be planted along a small fence or in a front garden. But at the same time, the culture gives a larger number of fruits in a fairly lit place. Attitude to moisture Tolerant: the tree easily tolerates a short drought, but there is no strong waterlogging of the soil. There are no special requirements for the soil. But it is best to choose a slightly acidic earth. Before planting, it is necessary to inspect the seedlings. They should not have leaves. The aboveground part should be fresh, with several shoots formed. It is necessary that the root system be whole, without damage, especially mechanical ones. If the tree is young, one -year -old, then its roots may not be so branched, and This is a normal phenomenon.\n\nThe diameter of the digging pit should be 0.5-0.8 m. The depth is 0.8-1 m. The distance between the seedlings is 3-6 m. Diggered the ground must be mixed with superphosphate, manure and wood ash. All this must be mixed, and on 1/3, pour into the hole. After the resulting slide, spill water (8-10 l). The liquid should be completely absorbed. The seedling carefully drops to the bottom of the hole right in the center. Gradually fall asleep Earth, but so as not to injure the rhizome. Upon completion of the transplant, the soil around is tamped. To care for Ryabina, some moments of agricultural technology should be observed.\n\n\n\tWatering. The mountain ash acutely needs water only in the event of a long drought. Irrigation should be carried out during the growing season and after harvesting. The rest of the time, the culture will independently extract water. It is worth remembering that one tree accounts for from 20 to 30 liters.\n\tFrom time to time, the trunk circle is loosened after watering. The procedure is not carried out so often, but it must be done to saturate the soil with oxygen, especially after a long drought.\n\tActively top dressing is introduced 3 years after the transplant. It can be compost or ammonia nitrate. Before the growing season, you can introduce a solution of poultry or mullein. Some summer residents, instead of organics, use the drug \"Agrolayif\".\n\tCutting. After winter, it is necessary to remove all dried and frozen branches. This is done before the start of the sapotage, so as not attract the attention of insects. Propagate the mountain ash in two ways: vegetative and generative. Generative implies growing in a seed method, when the seeds are removed from the fruits, treated, and then sown in the ground. The vegetative way is the reproduction of the overlapping cuttings, vaccination, a challenge or overgrown.\n\nYou can instill a new variety on such varieties of mountain ash as:\n\n\n\tNevrazhinskaya;\n\tOrdinary;\n\tMoravian. In spring, when cutting, the tree is examined for the presence of the first symptoms illness or insects.\n\nThe most common diseases:\n\n\n\tanthracnosis;\n\tbrown or gray spotting;\n\tseptoriosis;\n\tring mosaic;\n\tmoniliosis;\n\tscab;\n\trust;\n\tflour dew. In landscape design, mountain ash is used more often than other trees due to its presentable and beautiful appearance.\n\n\n\tFor example, arbors or small arches can be decorated with a mountain ash with a weeping crown. Make it a solo accent, or beat it in a composition with other low shrubs or flowers.|||PENDULA, a wearable ordinary decorative variety is recommended for urban landscaping far from industrial enterprises and motorways, in city courtyards, squares, school gardens, medical institutions, in gardens and exhibition halls, for the design of the recreation areas the average growth rate to 5 from 4 from 4 sinking, smooth gray long, large -large large -scale large -large large -large large -sized large -large -large -sized large -large -sided length - 20 on top dark green, below lighter yellow - red complex smooth tender large white The end of spring is large spherical orange-red red, orange orange-red medium from mid-spring to autumn, it is recommended to plant in the illuminated places moderate, in the dry period-regularly sprinkles well to top dressing early in the spring on the outer kidney at the start of the “thyce” of the branch and highly unpretentious maintenance of the main place of living Blabby rowan is a moderate climatic belt of the country. Standard characteristics:\n\n\n\tCrohn's type - sprawling;\n\tThe shape of the crown is round and openwork;\n\theight-up to 6-8 meters;\n\tShoots of red-brown in youth and yellowish-gray as they grow older, smooth;\n\tsheet plates are dark green, up to 20 cm long;\n\tThe flowers are white, have the shape of shields in the inflorescence. An interesting fact: the shape of the weeping crown is not inherited, but is formed by the gardener independently. You can begin formation only after the reaches of the age of 8-10 years. With a young seedling to carry out the plan not It will come out, as with a too adult tree. Many gardeners who have not yet encountered such a procedure think that it is difficult. But in fact, everything is easy if you determine the direction of growth of branches in a timely manner. It is important that already stronger shoots look in one direction. The formation of a tree should begin closer to the beginning of the season: in March or April. You can also make a mountain ash in a weed in the fall, around the last days of September. The main stages will be as follows.\n\n\n\tTo grow Black mountain ash, you will need to prepare materials and tools, among which there will be wooden pegs, a rope and wire.\n\tNext, the largest branches of the tree are carefully bent, doing this sequentially with each element. Beat all branches in one direction.\n\tTue of deformation of shoots is monitored that the bark does not break off. At the same time, it is taken into account that the branches should be pressed as much as possible to the ground.\n\tNext, the branches are released for a while and place places for installation Kolyshkov.\n\tWooden racks are installed on the marked areas, and then the branches are tied to them using a strong rope.\n\tThe ropes are removed a year later. This is enough for the mountain ash to acquire a weeping look. It is recommended to plant mountain ash in fertile soil, where the tree will take root faster. Although, if necessary, you can plant a plant in low -fruit soil.\n\nParticular attention should be paid to care.\n\n\n\tFormation. In the first years, too long shoots should be cut, and after binding It is recommended to ensure that the bark does not crack for pegs.\n\tWatering. In the first years, it is necessary to make up to 3 buckets under the barrel 1-2 times a month to ensure active culture growth. Adult watering trees do not require, only in drought should be watered 1 time a month 5-6 buckets.\n\tTop dressing. The first 2 years, while the mountain ash is growing, it is necessary to fertilize the soil with manure or other organic components. Then preference is given to mineral and complex compositions. In the fall, when it comes The rest period, potassium or superphosphate is introduced into the ground.\n\tLoosening. Dig the soil around the barrel of mountain ash every quarter. You need to loosen the ground for a thickness of at least 5 cm to provide the necessary flow of oxygen to the roots of the plant. In the spring, it is worthwhile to mulch the trunk circle so that the mountain ash receives a generous supply of nutrient components. Harring mountain ash are quite common among landscape designers. Possible options for using culture look So.\n\n\n\tArrangement of open spaces. It looks beautiful when the branches of mountain ash are freely scattered.\n\tLanding of single landings. The mountain ash looks good in such compositions due to the attention attracting the attention of the crown.\n\tGarden decoration. Especially relevant is the landing of mountain ash in the areas of country houses, where, due to its crown, a long -term tree can act as a New Year tree.\n\n\nRecently, dwarf options for weeping mountain ash are popular, which look attractive in large -scale landings among flowers and multi -track.|||Rowan Swedish, Sorbus Intermedia in the southern part of Sweden; It is found in the eastern part of Denmark (Bournholm), in the southwest of Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Poland is a triple hybrid between S. Aucuparia, S. Torminalis and either S.

This tree has a second name - Swedish mountain ash. It is noteworthy in that it does not require constant care, and the resulting fruits are many times tastier than that of an ordinary mountain ash. The formation of the crown of this tree occurs independently, but if you make its own adjustments in the form of its trimming, then the mountain ash will acquire a decorative character.\n\nThe flowers of the mountain ash appear in late May and hold until June. During this period, there is a sharp but pleasant smell. The flowers themselves look quite beautiful. They are white and collected by beams. Ovoid leaves have a pale green tint, and in the lower part they are grayish. The yellowing period begins in October, and then the tree acquires extraordinary beauty: bright fiery berries against the background Golden Crone. Planting mountain ash is very easy and simple. The main thing is to adhere to the correct sequence. After all, compliance with the algorithm is the key to future success. Rowan care is quite simple. Periodically you need to water it, plunge from weeds. It is also necessary to make mineral and natural fertilizers. Consider all this in more detail.\n\nRegular watering is very necessary for the plant. Abundant irrigation should be used for drought and high heat so that the soil does not dry out. Thanks to the done Mulching moisture will last longer near the roots of the plant, which means that watering can be carried out not so often. As mulch, straw, sawdust and all that way are suitable.\n\nIt is desirable to feed the mountain ash no earlier than 3 years after it was planted. In the spring for feeding, a mixture of potassium salt, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is used. And in the fall, they give a potassium mixture, as well as phosphorus. After the fertilizer is introduced, the earth is dug up to a depth of 15 cm. Next, a large amount is introduced water.\n\nAny cultural plant must be cut, but this must be done strictly according to certain rules, so as not to harm the tree. Correctly performed pruning will increase fruiting and help to prevent many possible diseases. It is preferable to do this in the summer, so the mountain ash will transfer the process more easily. The propagation will pass best if you do it in the spring of the year. And if you live in the southern regions, then the tree can be propagated at the end of September - the beginning of October. At this one Rowanings have several methods of reproduction. You can do everything according to the standard: cuttings or seeds. And you can go differently, in an in non -traditional way: with the help of layers and barbecue.\n\nIn order to use the second method, you need to perform the following points.\n\n\n\tDig and clean the earth from all kinds of weeds and various garbage. A digging must be done in a trunk circle.\n\tNext to the long branch of the mountain ash, you need to dig a small and shallow ditch.\n\tBend the selected The branch to the soil and secure it using metal brackets.\n\tNext, you need to wait a certain amount of time so that new processes appear on the branch.\n\tPour the resulting layering with humus and soil in the proportions of 1: 1.\n\tYou can separate the layering next year. After the separation, transplant it to a permanent place of growth. The Swiss mountain ash has good resistance to malware attacks and various diseases and infections. But still there are times when the immune system The tree weakens and fails, so in some years different diseases, pests can be seen.\n\nMost often there are diseases such as steam, powdery mildew, phomosis, septoria, rust and wood rot. And from insects can be damaged caterpillars, aphids, ticks and sawmills. To defeat all these ailments, they advise you to use special chemicals. You can also use folk methods, because they are also quite effective. If you have long wanted to make a certain The variety in the design of your front garden, the Swedish mountain ash will be a great option for this. It will fit perfectly and will be combined with other plants in any garden. The value of the tree lies in the fact that it looks unusual because of the leaves similar to oak, and because of the red-orange berries that give him variegated.\n\nThere are several interesting options for the location of this tree. Consider each of them.\n\n\n\tRows. Along any track, paths or even along the perimeter of the site It will be good to plant this tree with one continuous nearby.\n\tSingle landing. This method is suitable for adding a bright accent spot, which will be harmonious both in the very center of the site and somewhere near the fence. Planting options for one tree can be listed forever, so rely on your taste and do as you think it is necessary.\n\tTerritory near the house. If you do not have a separate site, then you can plant an intermediate mountain ash on lawns near your house.

These berries are arranged by clots up to 50 pieces in each. The fruit is full of mature in the autumn period, and they can remain on the trees throughout the winter. The described type of mountain ash is quite widely. The geography of his habitat covers the expanses of the Far East, as well as the forest and forest -steppe regions of Siberia. The plant can climb It is high enough in the mountains. Ryabina Sibirskaya is found in Altai, in the Kemerovo and Tomsk regions, as well as in Altai and in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. Given the potential height of the trees, many gardeners prefer to plant mountain ash on the border of the sites in order to avoid shading of individual zones. For example, a successful solution would be placed plants along the northern perimeter."

Yes, low to 1.2-1.5 to 0.7 rounded-pulled (in the young plant, the branches stretch vertically upward) scaly tightly pressed to the stem of yellow-green, Sometimes with a golden tint, in winter - with a bronze shade, green, bluish fleshy, with characteristic outgrowths in the form of hooks, open soil and with a closed root system - spring, summer and autumn (in the summer on a cool or rainy day, and in autumn at least 3 weeks before the upcoming frosts). open sunny place or light partial shade is unpretentious to soils, but dense is undesirable (on heavy clay soils you need drainage) moderate humidity, does not tolerate flooding (but in the first years of watering abundant, about 2 times a week, depending on the weather); It is necessary to arrange sprinkling (approximately 1 time in 7-10 days) to adapt well to urban polluted air, you need a good 5 (from -29 ° to -23 °) slowly growing, over 5-10 cm, almost all regions of Russia have excellent immunity to the diseases of the eastern Aurea Nana -this is a very interesting dwarf variety, whose needles of which have a needle. there are golden, yellowish, and in cold weather years - bronze hue. It grows in several trunks, presented in the form of a shrub. The plant has the following compact dimensions: the height of the twenty -year -old adult - no more than 1.5 meters; the volume of the crown usually does not exceed 70 centimeters. The eastern East Aurea Nana refers to slow -growing plants. During the year, young shoots are added about 5 cm long. The branches first stretch vertically, and then, gradually expanding, the crown acquires a rounded-pulled, ellipsoid form. There are two types of Aurea Nana varieties - Western and Eastern. In appearance, they are almost impossible to distinguish from each other. As already mentioned, the thuja eastern Aurea Nana refers to photophilous cultures. It is better to plant it in a sunny place, although the tree will be quite calm to a very small shadow, especially in hot hours. You can plant thuja both in spring and autumn. However, experts, as well as many amateur gardeners, note that in the spring the bushes are less sick, better They take root, during the warm season they manage to get stronger and prepare for wintering. The plant prefers slightly acidic loose soil. The preparation includes the following main points: the planting hole is dug to a depth of 50-60 centimeters; width is more than the volume of the roots of the seedling is approximately half; thuja love moist ground, but they cannot stand the flooding and close ground of groundwater, so they need to lay drainage on the bottom of the pit - 20 centimeters of expanded clay, gravel or fragmented brick; on top of them; The drainage layer pour a soil mixture consisting of sore ground and peat in a proportion of one to one; filling the pit up to half, install the seedling in the center and neatly add the remaining soil; then the earth around the stem is compacted, slightly trampled, well watered; to reduce the evaporation of moisture, the so -gathered circle is mulged in finely chopped pine forest, chipping or peat; when landing, it is necessary to ensure that the root neck of the young bush is located on a flush with the upper layer soil. The thuja eastern is a rather unpretentious culture. In the first summer, young plants need frequent and abundant watering - at least twice a week, depending on weather conditions. In addition, in severe heat, the bushes will be very grateful for spraying and sprinkling. Then you can reduce the frequency to 1 time in 7-10 days, but in no case should you allow the drying of the earth in the trunk circle. Care consists in timely weeding, loosening of the soil after each watering or rain and Pouring an additional layer of mulch. Eastern variety, unlike the western one, has less frost resistance, therefore, in late autumn, before the onset of cold weather, young plantings cover. In this form, thuja tolerates frosts and severe winds well, but a destructive effect can have a bright spring sun, from which burns on the bark appear and tender needles suffer. Therefore, in the spring you need to fix the light covering material in the form of an awning over the plantings. In the spring They carry out sanitary pruning, removing damaged and dried branches. This variety does not need formation, since it itself forms an attractive crown in the form of a slightly elongated ball. It is useful to feed plants for better growth and development. In the spring, nitrogen -containing fertilizers are added, during the summer those in which phosphorus is present will be useful, and, finally, in the fall - potassium. The eastern “Aurea Nana”, like all other types of thuja, in no case should be fed humus, including manure. The tree may die from this. Thanks to the compact size and the attractive appearance of the Aurea Nana, Tui is widely used in landscape design. The bushes planted at a close distance form a dense and beautiful hedge, which should not be constantly trimmed and aligned. These plants will decorate the alpine slide or rocky kindergarten, they will look original in the center of the flowerbed with bright red or blue annual flowers, in solitary or group composition on the lawn.|||WoodWardii, Woodword USA 1891 West is planted as a undergrowth with high trees to create corners of “wild nature”, as solitarians, for hedges and decoration of alleys and compact medium-sized up to 3 to 1.5 m high and 1-1.5 m in diameter, dense dense, straight lines, flatter, the more the branches are more older. Green slowly growing 5-10 cm shiny scales of the needles from dark green to light green brown-green no small dark brown from Open soil forms open soil in sunny areas, and shade, however, due to the lack of light, its crown can thin, and the needles - to turn grows on all fresh or wet (raw), fertile soils from acidic to alkaline young seedlings require weekly watering in the amount of 10 liters of water, reacts well to irrigation in hot days; Water procedures need to be carried out in the morning after planting thuja must be fertilized in a couple of years, do it with compositions, containing potassium and phosphorus, compost is performed in March-April before the heyday of the kidneys and is very sensitive to sunburn, so the tree is sprayed with special preparations that protect the needles from dehydration adapts well to urban polluted air, adult plants are binded to avoid damage to the damage to the snow mass of the snowy massacre. (from -29 ° to -23 °) The average western thuja \"Woodwardi\" is a coniferous perennial. Dimensions The tree is not too impressive - over 10 years of life, it hardly intersects a mark of 50 centimeters. However, an adult plant can grow to a height of 2 or 3 meters - the diameter of the crown in this case will be approximately 3 meters. The main advantages of this variety are its visual attractiveness, as well as resistance to a negative environment. To a permanent habitat, the seedling can be transplanted only 2 years after it is cut off from a tree. The soil should be light, be sure to containing peat and sand. If necessary, the excess of the second component is easily adjusted by adding clay. If the soil is too heavy, then the drainage layer should additionally create, the depth of which ranges from 15 to 20 centimeters, and also make compost. The planting of seedlings begins in the spring, which allows Tue Woodwardi to get used to and take root until autumn frosts. Thui Woodardi is not too whimsical, and therefore the care process for her is quite simple. Tuya \"Woodwardi\" It is customary to propagate with the help of seeds or a vegetative way. The seed method is used to grow a species variety of culture, as it takes a lot of time - from 3 to 5 years, and also most often leads to the loss of maternal signs of the variety. By ordinary gardeners, reproduction is selected using cuttings. The process begins in April when cutting a 40-centimeter cuttings along with a heel. To avoid the destructive effects of diseases, it is necessary to regularly inspect thuja for common diseases. When infected with stem rot, the color of the needles changes, and the barrel is covered with growths and rotten areas. To save the plant, you have to quickly remove the affected areas and treat the emerging wounds with Oliphi. When the roots rot, the needles also change their color. The bush begins to dry and as if decreasing in size, in addition, softening its lower part occurs. Such a thue cannot be saved - it will have to be destroyed, and together with A layer of land where it grew. In the landscape design of the Woodardi thuja is used both to create a hedge and the usual design of the site. Often the plant is placed along the roads, having previously planted it in a large pot or leaving it in a natural form. An evergreen ball fits perfectly into flower beds, becomes a decoration of verandas or balconies. When creating the alpine slides, Tui \"Woodwardi\" is chosen as an attractive view of the accent.|||F. J.

There are no relatively high arches for the winter from the scorching sun, especially the plants are especially suffered from burns of early spring. The aggravation and smoke of urban air when growing in places where snowy bullets are possible, it is not required to bind the crown, but for zishchita of bushes in snowy winters it is necessary to build a protective frame above the high -cost plant 4 (from -34 ° to -29 °), 5 (from -29 ° to -23 °) are not recommended planting in places with strong drilling by the winds of the western thuja Globe by the winds. unpretentiousness and small size of the crown. These properties made her in demand both amateurs and experienced landscapes. Bright needles Painted non -standard, makes this plant suitable: for a summer residence; for a country house; for a city street; for a park; for container landscaping of a terrace, roof, and other places. This moment is no less important than the landing site. Experts advise planting thuja, like other coniferous crops, in the spring or early autumn. It is necessary to carefully look at the same time that the earth has time to warm up or does not have time to cool. In order for the planted thuja to be guaranteed to take root, it is required: regularly water it; protect it from Weeds by ruthless troops; loosen and remove the crust formed after irrigation (with the greatest depth of 0.08-0.1 m). Golden Globe can suffer from: bark beets; Tyuy aphids; spider mites. Golden Globe can be used to decorate the landscape in both group and single format. But in any case, the crowding of landing should be excluded and the proper expanse. A good combination for this variety of thuja will be conifers with dark green needles. You will only have to alternate Plots of vegetation are of different colors. Paired bushes are mainly planting on the right and left of the: gate on the site; dominant small shape; porch of a modest house; a front entrance to a cottage or mansion.|||Dzhanded Gold, Janyd Gold, Golden Smaragd West in coniferous compositions and hedges and the best golden shape from the popular Smaragd high-growing 4-6 m 2-2.5 m narrow, strictly pyramidal at the young tree-dense, in the adult-more loose short, flattened average growth rate 10-20 cm when blooming, young needles have an orange shade of a scaly soft flat tightly pressed to the shooting golden golden green, brightly golden small about 1 The oblong egg-shaped brown open soil at any time of the year of the hole is 60-80 cm, the distance between plants is 0.5-3 m Sun, the partial shade is moderately wet, a neutral-rich neutral humus at least once a week in a bucket under the plant. When landing in hot times, you can water 2 times a week in the spring, choosing complex mineral mixtures for conifers, 50-60 g each per m2 times every 2 years, removing no more than a third of the shoot, and additional watering and sprinkling with water in the crown in the heat are recommended It does not tolerate droughts for the first 3 years after planting the plant needs to be a slight shade from the hot summer sun adapts well to urban polluted air, it is necessary in the first three years. Adult plants tolerate cold without protection high 4 (from -34 ° to -29 °) “Golden Smaragd”, which can be literally translated as “Golden Emerald” -this is a variety, first created in Poland by a breeder Edward a cube. The sizes of the planted tree are initially small, and it grows Pretty slowly - a maximum of 20 cm per year. By the ten-year-old age, the thuja reaches a mark of 2.5 meters and subsequently also continues to increase, growing to 5 meters or more. The hwalks in the plant in the plant are green-golden, which caused its name, they remain this year round. If you rub the foliage with your fingers, you can feel the usual cool aroma of needles. In the spring, small cones form on a tree, in the fall, thuja drops them. The crown of the Golden Smarada is a conical shape, taps up. IN The width can reach almost 2 meters, but basically the indicators range between 1 and 1.8 meters. They plant thuja, as a rule, in autumn or spring. Spring planting is preferable, because over the summer the plant will become stronger, acclimatized and completely inhabited on the site. If the time has already been lost, you can plant thuja and in the fall, but you can’t delay, you have to try to do it as soon as possible. Only in this way will the plant have the opportunity to develop a little until the winter to survive it. By the way, if You bought a thuja in a pot, then you can plant it in early June. The first preparatory stage for landing becomes the selection of a site. Unlike many other plants, Golden Smaragd does not suffer too much from sunburn, so you can plant it in an open area. Caring for Golden Smaragd is not too difficult and burdensome, but the care should be regular. The first condition for harmonious development is, of course, watering. Thuja of this variety requires stable moisture, so It will have to be watered once a week. If you do not adhere to this rule, the plant will begin to dry, lose attractiveness. Tuya Western and sprinkling are very fond of, after which her needles acquire a beautiful shine, and the dust and small pests are washed off with water. After watering, it is advisable to loosen the soil near the plant. Thus, you will provide oxygen access to the root system of a tree. You need to loosen not too deep - no more than 10 cm, since the roots are located close to Earth surfaces. Cutting is another rule that a gardener note should be noted. There are several types of wrappers, but the most popular of them is sanitary. It is produced at any time except winter. Such a procedure is designed to save a tree from dry, sick, exhausted branches. After it, Tui has new forces, which she will no longer spend on the obsolete specimens. With good and conscientious care, thuja western is extremely affected by diseases. But it's still It happens, so you should be prepared for everything. Let's look at the main diseases of the thuja, as well as methods of combating them. Glibel ailments. Fungins that provoke late blight and various types of rot, have long become an attack by gardeners. The disease can be determined by the characteristic smell of rot from the ground, yellowing and wilting of shoots, and the appearance of mold. As soon as the “diagnosis” is made, all patients are immediately cut and burned away from the site. The remaining parts of the plants are treated with strong fungicides. In addition, remember that if the disease is recognized late, and the fungus has already braided the roots, there must be completely dug up, replacing the earth in which it grew up. Tuyuyuyuyshchitovka is tiny malicious bugs that breed at an enviable speed. Yellowish sores will be told about their appearance, which will become more and more every day. Treatment should be fast, otherwise the plant soon threatens death. To combat the false loving, carbophos insecticides are used. You can also To purchase a special adhesive tape that prevents the movement of insects on the barrel. This disease, like Shutta, mainly affects only young trees. Plants noticeably fade, dry, the crown darkens, and the needles fall. The first thing to do is to remove all the branches affected by the disease. Then the plant is sprayed with the HOM drug, it can be replaced with a burgundy mixture. If the treatment is performed, but there are no results, try the Fundazole. In a bucket of water, 20 g is diluted Means, then water the land near TUI, spraying is not required. “Golden Smaragd” is a plant that feels great both in a clean area and in a gasket of urban area, which is why it is often used to landscaping park zones. Thui Western is good in that it looks majestic both alone and in the company of other plants. Next to her will look elegant roses and dahlias, as well as a carpet of small petunias. An interesting idea will be the creation A small hedge. As already mentioned, the distance between thuja should be at least half a meter if you want a more dense fence. A distance of a meter will allow you to create a sparse fence. The plant with Tuya looks great with plants of other conifers, but they should be compact. For example, it can be decorative pines and Christmas trees, beautifully decorated juniper thickets. Tuya looks very interesting in the design of boxwood or hydrangea. More demanding gardeners can create On the site, whole sculptures from TUI, but for this you should independently learn professional sculptural pruning or regularly invite a specialist for correction.|||Danica Denmark 1948 West for single landings, decorative groups, borders, mountaineering and a dwarf shrub variety, which has decorativeness throughout the year, a low-growing 0.6-0.8 1 40 cm in diameter in a spherical, dense, dense dense, densely located vertical-green slowly growing one in a height of 5 cm, in a height of 5 cm, in a height. 3-4 cm width exfoliating, from gray-brown to reddish brilliant scaly, soft small is located vertically thick Green brownish-green is not superficial, wide, sensitive to soil compaction very small up to 0.6 rounded brown are rarely open soil between the bushes themselves can be 0.5-3 m. If a body hedge is created-0.5-0.7 m (with a two-row landing), it is advisable to grow in the shadows on any soil, but it can grow on any soil, but prefers fertile, loamy, sufficiently moisturized soils alkaline moderate fertilizers for conifers. The pruning along the crown is drought -resistant, the crown is susceptible to sunburn, the plant needs to cover the sunlight in the early spring period with twine with twine with twine so that they do not break under the weight of snow or can prevent the pernicious effect of winter ice rains hide the winter -hardy crown (from -40 ° to -34 unprotected from winds (open) are not characteristic of the crown of the western variety of thuja has a spherical shape and small sizes. The tree reaches the largest height not early than in the 15th year of its development, so Tuyu “Danika” is attributed to slow -growing varieties. This type of coniferous evergreen plant is not natural. He appeared thanks to the efforts of scientists-surgical from Denmark, who brought Danik in the middle of the 20th century. Such a variety as “Danika” does not differ in a large species variety, since it includes only 1 of them - “Danika Aurea”. This coniferous shrub uses a large The popularity of both experienced gardeners and beginners, as well as landscape designers. The characteristic distinctive features of this variety are miniature sizes and an unusual gold color. The maximum height of the Danika Aurea is about 80 centimeters. In winter, the shrub acquires a unique bronze tint. The plant is actively used in mountaineering, complex compositions, as well as for landscaping. Planting is a process on which further development depends Tui. That is why this stage should be paid to special attention. So, first you should choose the optimal place for landing. This can become a sunny or half -leisure place, but in no case is it recommended to plant a shrub in the shade (for example, under the house or under the crowns of trees). The thing is that the lack of sun can lead to the fact that the plant will lose its decorative properties. The care of thuja varieties \"Danika\" in itself is quite simple and does not require a large the amount of costs (temporary, labor, monetary, etc.). In general, it is believed that the plant can grow well and develop even without watering. At the same time, nerds note that on moist and fertile soil, these processes will pass more actively and faster. Moisturization will be especially relevant in the hot and arid periods of the year. In order to make a sufficient amount of fluid, one plant needs to be allocated at least 10–20 liters of pure water. With prolonged drought and high Air temperatures of the crown of the plant are recommended to irrigate with warm water. In addition, mulching includes the most important care events. You can propagate the thuja varieties \"Danika\" in several ways: seeds and cuttings. To begin with, it should be noted that the method of reproduction by seeds is used only in extreme cases, if there is no possibility of propagation by cuttings. The fruits of thuja, which are essentially cones, are collected in the autumn (and the later, the better). In general, you should wait for the moment as the seeds are completely matured and begin to spill out of the cones naturally. Generally speaking, thuja varieties of \"Danika\" is a fairly stable plant in relation to various diseases and pests. However, even such a stable shrub can be subjected to negative influences. So, thuja is susceptible to infection with false loving and spider mites. These insects eat needles, which leads to yellowing and cringing the crown. In addition, pests can eat and The root system of the bush, which is the cause of the loss of aesthetic appearance. Thui varieties \"Danika\" are actively used in the design of landscapes. The shrub is used to design a variety of decorative compositions that decorate the areas. For example, a dwarf plant is often used for landscaping. Tua is a traditional plant from which hedges and borders make up. In addition, landscape slides are often organized from the Danika variety. The shrub has very miniature In the size, in connection with this, it can also be planted in special containers, which adorn not only open areas, but also terraces, balconies, loggias, as well as halls and foyers of public places.|||Yellow Ribbon, Western yellow tape is used in group plantings, to create curtains, alleys, cut and free-growing hedges, coniferous, wood-brown and mixed groups and one of the most decorative forms Medium -ine 3 1.5 cone-shaped bright yellow, sometimes orange slowly, slowly comprehensive-member 10-15 cm scaly cross-broodly located along the escape is tightly pressed to the escape, dark green, later light green with a bronze tint there is no superficial With several basic deep roots and branched thin side, small over 1 brown open soil spring or early autumn the distance between plants is 0.5-3 m Sun, the partial shade for fertility is growing on substrates of different acidity, but prefers slightly acidic soils regularly, once a week in spring and autumn does not like dry air is not recommended To grow in areas with strong winds tolerates the conditions of the city in the first year After landing, the high 4 (from -34 ° to -29 °) is better developing in moist places, the description of the Tui variety \"Ello Ribbon\" (the botanical name Thuja Occidentalis Yellow Ribbon) allows you to get complete information about its appearance. Among the main parameters, it is worth noting the following.\n\n\n\tThe size of an adult tree. Its height reaches 2.0–2.5 m, the average achievement of this indicator is 15 years. Up the tree grows 10-12 cm, in diameter increases by no more than 8 cm (maximum indicators - 0.8 m).\n\tThe shape of the crown is conical, close to the hawstard, with a rounded base and a sharp top. The growth density of branches is high, many shoots are formed.\n\tThe main properties of the variety: high frost resistance - the ability to withstand cold up to −35 degrees Celsius; wind resistance of the plant; resistance to ultraviolet rays. A popular decorative plant with bright needles - a thuja Western \"Hellou Ribbon\" - can be propagated by one of two available methods. At The variety of seeds loses its characteristics-so you can get ordinary wilder without any characteristic features of color. Growing a seedling in this case takes up to 5 years. With this propagation, the resulting plant will be immediately adapted to the climatic conditions of the terrain. The cuttings of a growing season allows you to get thuja that retain their varietal characteristics. The escape of the second or third year is separated from the barrel, from the upper part of the parental tree. After The stalk will form the root system, it is planted in the soil or into a container for further cultivation in a closed format. The coniferous trees of the type of thuja West are unpretentious in choosing a place for their landing. The plant is recommended to be placed in dry areas with loamy and sandy soils. A high level of groundwater is not suitable, but moisture access is important to preserve the brightness of the needles. With constant flooding of the roots in the plant, late blight develops, from which thuja does not have sufficient protection. There are also requirements for soil acidity - it should be in the PH 4.5–6.5 range. Exotic decorative thuja \"Ello Ribbon\" is a very popular plant among gardeners. It is high demand that leads to multiple falsifications related to the sale of seedlings. In order not to make a mistake in choosing a young tree for planting a western thuja, you should pay attention to the following points.\n\n\n\tType of root system. The survival closed above, while the plant should not be easy Exit from the pot with a lump of earth. Roots in drainage holes is a good sign. With an open system, on the surface of the rhizome should not be rot, mold, any deforming nodes, growths, and formations.\n\tHealth of the crown. The needles of the healthy thuja of the Western should have an elastic, strong structure. The shade should correspond to the varietal characteristic. If there is doubt, wipe the tip of the branch with a damp cloth. If there are traces of paint on it - for a noble decorative variety Given a less exotic option.\n\tThe condition of the trunk and branches. If the seedling is affected by parasites, they will be visible during visual inspection. Smolf sweat, holes in the bark, other extraneous traces on the surface of the barrel are the reason for refusing to buy. The main difficulties for gardeners are the landing and care of Tuya Western Yellow Ribbon. But upon closer examination, these processes do not cause trouble. A seedling bought in a nursery in a pot, with a closed type of root system, you can To plant at any time of the year, from April to October. To take place, the plant needs at least 30 days before the first frost. With an open root system in the northern regions, landing is carried out in the spring, in the southern - in the middle of autumn. The following procedures can be attributed to the regular measures of the Western “Ello Ribbon”.\n\n\n\tWatering. A moisture -loving plant requires a mandatory replenishment of fluid reserves. In the heat, watering is carried out three times a week, the rest of the time weekly, 1 bucket of the same. It is useful to sprinkle wood, showing brightness of coloring and stimulating the release of etheric substances.\n\tTop dressing. In the first 2 years, there is no need for it. After the introduction of potassium and phosphorus additives is recommended, but nitrogen compounds are contraindicated in slowly growing varieties for most of the year, they are introduced only in the spring. Fresh organic fertilizers are not too useful for thuja.\n\tRage and loosening of the soil. The close location of the root system to the surface of the soil increases the needs Tui West to the quality of aeration. Weeding and loosening help to normalize air exchange. Mulching the basal zone will be useful.\n\tCro -trimming. It is carried out only according to sanitary indications, regular haircut is not required. When forming an original crown of a non -shaped type, when trimming, it is forbidden to affect more than 1/3 of the shoots or cut off the top. The western western varieties Yellow Ribbon is considered an excellent element of the decorative design of the site. With its help, you can easily form Original hedge of medium height. The tree is also suitable for urban landscaping, feels good in areas with adverse ecology. A solicter landing or the formation of alleys from TUI “ElOU Ribbon” looks good in large areas."

The midday sun is not welcome, but scattered lighting should be maximum. Abundant, but not very frequent irrigation, adjusted to dry soil for branching, stimulating the growth of strong lateral shoots is better to plan for February-March, before the start of active growth. And shorten the shoots not with pinching, but by trimming at 5-6 kidneys (leaves) or even more, Leaving at least 2 buds on the escape. It is better to focus on the appearance of roots in drainage holes. The transplant in the spring is preferable. It is appropriate to make top dressing only during the period of active growth. Every 2-3 weeks use a standard dose of fertilizers for ficus or decorative-deciduous plants. In winter, lighting is increased as much as possible, scattering screens are not needed. Drawing up is only welcome. This type of ficus does not like rearrangements, a frequent change of space turns into a leaf fall. care The average degree of complexity is rotting of the roots, spider mites, powdery marthes, shields, a favorable environment for this representative of the flora is observed only in the climate of Ceylon, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In his native countries, ficus is called a tree of desires. Growing in wild conditions of nature, the plant can spread to an area of ​​up to several acres. Banyan form huge ground roots growing like branches in a horizontal direction. Such processes An uncountable quantity grows, their distinguishing feature is the absence of villous cover. The roots of the ficus are slowly develop, over time, most of them dry out, not reaching the ground. The processes reaching to the ground under favorable conditions are quickly rooted. The aboveground part of the roots thickens, and thus new wood trunks are formed. In addition, Banan is fruit. Small fruits of orange color are happy to eat birds and mammals, and the remaining seeds also They contribute to the growth of the “Fulfillment of the Wishes”. The Baganan is very large - up to 40 m, and the crown of this tree can cover up to 500 square meters. m of land. Dense large foliage is another distinguishing feature of this plant. Each formed sheet has an elliptical shape and reaches 25 cm long. Under a durable protective layer on the leaf plate, there are veins with a light green color. Wild ficus is a rapidly growing tree with an increase of up to 1 m per year. In order for culture It grew well and developed in the conditions of the room, it is necessary to correctly choose the plant. It is worth adhering to the following rules. Choose a young one. Look at the tree for damage and shake slightly. If the leaves fall, then the plant is not worth buying. Do not purchase a tree in the cold. The ficus purchased in winter is poorly adapted. The root system should not have a black or brown color. Bengal ficuses are considered unpretentious representatives of the flora with a flexible character, however Flower breeders need to follow the elementary rules for the care of a tree. If this is not done, the luxurious symbol of life will turn into a sore and capricious creature that drops the leaves. Ring of home care: do not forget to water the ficus in a timely manner; provide the temperature regime; make sure that the air is not overpred; the tree should grow in a light room; as necessary, be sure to transplant ficus; regularly receive and feed. There is nothing in the propagation of this culture Complex. You can get a new plant by cutting a stalk 10-15 cm long from an adult copy. It is better to first process the growth stimulant, and then place in the water until the roots appear, this happens after a couple of weeks. When the root system gets stronger, the young plant is planted in the ground. There is another option - the stalk is rooted in the ground, covering it with plastic film on top. After 7 days, the plant is fed, and when the tree begins to grow, they fertilize again.|||Type of Ficus Benjamina Benjamina wood, shrub at home at home grows rapidly, reaching a height of up to 200-300 evergreen wide gray, with rare brown strokes, drooping glossy oval-oval with a pointed apex 6–13 2-6 thin-and-skinned, smooth gilding of peristopecessor, central vein. It is weakly expressed, with 8-12 pairs of side veins, green -sized green -sided about 2 cm is important that the soil does not hypothermia, should not be lower than 14 ° C, the optimum temperature The content of the ficus 25-30 ° C in summer and 16–20 ° C in winter Fikusam Benjamin with motley leaves needs good lighting, scattered light is suitable for varieties with green leaves and partial shade needs to monitor the condition of the earthen coma and water the plant in the summer in the summer you need increased humidity and spraying the crown with water is very popular in indoor flower growing, Phytodesign and landscaping of the premises of Ficus Benjamin is a representative of the genus of the tutov family. It is growing in Asian countries (including southeastern)-China, India, as well as in the northern regions of Australia. This evergreen perennial plant (shrub or wood) with well-developed roots can reach a 25-meter height in natural conditions of growth. In order for Benjamin's ficus to grow well at home, you need to carefully and correctly take care of it and follow certain rules. The root system of the ficus is constantly developing and growing, the old pot becomes cramped, and in The bottom holes of the container appear roots. In this case, it is necessary to transplant the plant into a more spacious pot. Praise ficus in early spring. Young plants need an annual transplant for 5 years. Upon reaching this age, an adult plant is made after 2-3 years. However, annually you need to remove the upper layer of the soil in a pot of adult ficus and pour fresh ground. You can express the ficus purchased in the store at home only after its transplantation. But It can be implemented after 2-3 weeks: this time is necessary that the ficus is used to new conditions of detention. When transplanting, you can use universal, slightly acidic soil. You can independently make a soil mixture of such components: deciduous (garden) soil - 2 parts, peat, well -rotten compost and sand - 1 part. For an adult ficus, vermiculite, pine bark and charcoal can be added to this mixture. For transplantation, ceramic, clay is used for transplantation pot. The new container should be more than the old one by about 3 cm. It is not recommended to use a very large container, as this will lead to the excessive development of the root system. It is not difficult to transplant ficus: the earth in the pot is slightly moistened - it is easier to extract the plant. In order not to damage the roots, ficus needs to be carefully removed from the pot along with the soil lump and, without removing it, place the plant in a new pot. Usually use the method of transplanting plants from the old pot to the new one. Then you need to fill the container with fresh soil. The transplanted ficus cannot be watered for 2-3 days, and then watered as usual. Ficus Benjamin loves attentive and caring care, non -compliance with which can lead to his disease. If the ficus grows poorly, the leaves turn yellow and fall in him, then he is sick. His diseases can have fungal origin or occur due to damage to harmful insects. Here are the most dangerous diseases. Root rot. She is incurable and therefore Dangerous for ficus. Signs of root rot are the appearance of sluggish leaves, a rapid change in their color (they turn yellow), as well as the presence of an unpleasant odor from the soil. It is better to throw a sore flower without taking it out of the pot. The occurrence of this disease will help to avoid the correct watering regime: you need to prevent waterlogging and stagnation of water, pour water from the pallet on time. A gray rot is another fungal infection that affects the ficus. Its symptoms are dark spots, appearing on the leaves and on the stem near the roots. In the sick plant, you need to remove all the affected leaves, parts of the plant and examine the roots. If they are affected, it is urgent to transplant ficus into a new pot and replace the soil. Plant treatment with fungicidal agents is also effective. Incorrect care and excess moisture are the main causes of the disease. If the foliage is covered with a gray raid, then this indicates a damage to a soot fungus. With extensive lesion, the foliage needs tore and spray the plant with a solution of fungicide. Single foci of the soot fungus are removed with a strong soap solution with which the leaves are wiped.|||Danielle variety Benjamin Fikus Socus Socus has an irritating effect when it enters the skin, and when absorbed it can cause nausea, there is no high tall with strongly elongated ends large matte green does not grow very quickly up to 50 cm per season, the plant is thin, it is easy to take any shape, and the pressed branches are easily fused into the same rather nutritious soil with good drainage 18-24 ° C is less demanding on bright lighting than variegated varieties; It can grow in partial shade at high air temperature, a plentiful regular for giving wood requires pruning every 3-4 years in spring every two weeks from spring to autumn with a balanced fertilizer for indoor plants is unpretentious in the departure of the kind of ficuses, the family of Benjamin “Daniel” includes evergreen multi-year trees, many-year-old trees. Bushes have more than 800 different types. The maximum height of the trees of this family can reach 30 m. The natural habitat for ficus are the forests of India, China, East Asia, and the northern part of Australia. Over the long period of existence, these plants have gained various life forms: from trees of huge sizes to very miniature. Ficus is an unpretentious plant and organizing proper care at home is not so difficult. This does not require special knowledge of gardening, it is enough to take into account and fulfill the following conditions: a suitable place accommodation; sufficient amount of light; necessary level of heat and humidity; timely watering; regular pruning and transplantation; top dressing and prevention of diseases. An important stage in the seasonal care of the Daniel ficus is the top dressing of the plant. Flosing ficus is recommended from spring to December. Universal complexes, as well as various organic concentrates, are perfect for top dressing. At the same time, it is recommended to observe the “reaction” of the ficus to the new “food”. In case of darkening, Yellowing or falling of the leaves Fertilizer is recommended to change or suspend. Adhering to simple recommendations, Benjamin's ficus “Daniel” can be propagated by the following methods. A process of kidneys and leaves, cut off from the top, is placed in water. After 14-20 days, the process will take the roots, it will be possible to transplant it to the prepared substrate. In order to grow air layouts, it is necessary to cut the strained branch of the plant and remove part from it bark. Then the cut place is lubricated with a root -forming agent and covered with sphagnum, wrapped in a plastic film on top. It is especially important to control the presence of moisture at the site of the cut. A month later, roots appear on the branch. Semen. Seeds are planted in a prepared and fertilized earthen mixture, covered with polyethylene and placed in a warm place. After 7-14 days, you can already notice the first sprouts, which are planted separately. A serious threat to Daniel is such Parasites: small aphids, shield, powdery worm, spider mite. At the initial stages of infection, pests will help to cope with them soap essence and warm shower, and in complex, advanced cases, you can not do without special chemical insecticides. Excessive watering can contribute to the infection of the roots with a fungus. The main signs of root rot are yellowing, wilting and rapid darkening of the leaves. If the disease is not eliminated in time, then the plant may die. Incorrectly organized care At home, other fungal diseases can also contribute, such as church spurosis and anthracnosis. The most important advantage of the ficus is that it is a completely “non -conference” plant, as evidenced by numerous reviews of flower growers and gardeners. The flesh of foliage and its juice has medicinal properties and are used in traditional and traditional medicine. Ficus tinctures are part of many therapeutic drugs, antibiotics. The plant is a \"green orderly\", since It is able to filter air in the room, helps to accumulate positive energy."

Some sources indicate that it belongs to the Afdodelovs, but now the latter are considered subfamily, hence the discrepancies. The name of Havortia is owed to the scientist Edian Khavort, who studied the African flora. In nature, it can look like a kind of bush of meter height. In indoor conditions, it is a compact plant that grows up to about 20 cm both up and in width. Since the Havortia at home grows almost in deserts, it requires a light sandy loam, with good water permeability. It is better to take the composition approximately as follows:\n\n\n\tcoarse sand;\n\tclay-water soil (you can add leaf);\n\tSmall shell.

A long peduncle appears from the middle of the outlet, it can reach from 50 to 90 cm. At the very end of the stem, several small whitish flowers bloom without smell, which have a spike -shaped location, but located at some distance from each other. The African origin of the striped Havortia led to the features of its cultivation in indoor conditions. To survival in dry climate It is adapted very well, which confirms the reviews of flower growers. There are cases when the Khavortia forgotten for several months did not die and was completely restored after irrigation. To decorate the interior, compositions from succulents of various species are often used, but several bushes of striped chawort, planted in one wide container, look very decorative. Moreover, propagating these plants is not difficult. There are several ways. Since succulents Sensitive to excess moisture, the most dangerous for them are rot.

Even an amateur newcomer can cope with the departure of him. However, for The favorable growing of the flower still does not prevent the knowledge of the correct content of this culture. An apparent plant may well be in the shade, although the rays of the sun will not interfere during the day. Therefore, it is optimal to place it on the windowsill with a sufficient amount of light. However, in the summer of the year, it is not recommended to expose a pot with a flower under the open sunlight, as they can harm the leaves, as a result of which the latter will become dry and the plant will begin Failing. Coolorophytum feels great at the optimal room temperature in the room +15-20 degrees, but at +10 degrees it already freezes, so this temperature regime is best not to be allowed.

It is established that the germination of seeds of this plant is quite small and it is no more than 35%. For comfortable growth, it is recommended to transplant the plant once a year. The transplant is carried out from March to February to the phase of active growth. When transplanting It is advisable to choose a larger capacity, since this plant has a very large root system. It is best to use good soil with sod soil and humus, in it the plant takes root faster and more painless. The old plant is allowed to transplant once every 3 years, and it is best to use the old lump of earth. The optimal choice of a new capacity will be the one that is 10% more than the previous one.

Saturated green leaves, covered with white stripes in the center or edges. This plant was domesticated at the end of the 19th century. It was during this period that European experts deduced several samples for growing a flower in indoor conditions in the territory of European countries. So that the plant feels remarkably and pleases with a healthy appearance, it needs enough moisture, heat and light. Despite this, the flower can survive a slight Lack of lighting. Also, he is not scared of slight drying out of the earth and changes in temperature conditions. Due to these characteristics, the plant is ideal for novice flower growers. The easiest way to propagate the plant is to press a baby with developed air roots from a mother bush. The vegetative method of propagation allows you to grow a new flower in the shortest possible time. If the conditions for the development and growth of the plant are comfortable, the shrub begins to form several tiers of children who are ready for a transplant to a new place. Each of the processes is rooted without problems and eventually forms into a full and adult plant. The efforts of breeders were bred by the following varieties of chlorophytum.\n\n\n\tA species called Bonnie is characterized by twisted leaves resembling large curls. Clorophytum Khokhlatty has special qualities in air purification in the rooms. Thanks to amazing properties, it is often grown in medical institutions, schools, children's gardens and other similar institutions. In order to study the effectiveness of the plant, scientific research was carried out.

The only one Care-a raised bed and 2-3 centimeters of water per week.\n\nThese plants have quite deep and very persistent roots, so they grow well even with slight attention and care. If there is a desire to stimulate the cultivation of a larger number of leaves, you can cut the stalk of the flower, and the plant will give several more crops. In June-July, sorrel sour (or, as it is also called, ordinary) is a type of hardy perennial herbs of the Polygonaceae family or, in simple words, buckwheat, which Widely distributed in regions with a temperate climate. Its name in Latin is Rumex acetosa, so do not confuse it with other species (garden or French). The birthplace of this plant is Europe or North Asia. It has been used from ancient times for salad and as greens. The name sorrel comes from the old French word Surelle, meaning \"sour.\"\n\nThe common sorrel is divided into different varieties, some of them include such characteristics:\n\n\n\tBelvilles variety The most frost -resistant, and its taste is not as saturated as that of its relatives;\n\tLarge -leaved is one of the rapidly growing varieties, so if you need to get a crop faster, it will be a good option;\n\tMalachite is also fast -growing, and its crop can be harvested already 40 days after planting, but the variety is very unfavorable for problem weather;\n\tBroad-leaved-it will also be possible to harvest after 40 days, it is winter-hardy, and it can be grown for 4 years in one place. Sorrel It is worth growing no more than three or four years in one bed, because the amount of crop will still decrease after so many years. To understand whether the plant has begun to grow old, you need to pay attention to the leaves - they will become smaller and less, and there will be very few familiar large ones, or they will be completely absent. Spring can be grown from the end of spring to autumn. From the plant itself, it is necessary to collect and cut only what is needed (it is very reminiscent of a salad or herbs, where You can cut out the outer leaves, and the crop will continue to give foliage). Harvesting can be started when sorrel reaches 10-15 centimeters in height. The common sorrel mainly grows to 90 centimeters, and its leaves reach 15 centimeters. The smallest and youngest leaves are best for salads, also giving food a sour taste similar to citrus. You can collect sorrel in fresh form from spring to winter, when it dies.\n\nWhen harvesting, it is worth paying attention to such peculiarities:\n\n\n\tFor better taste, it is worth choosing the young, delicate and small leaves of sorrel-the leaves should be bright green;\n\tYoung delicate sorrel is best combined with salads and other greenery, sorrel leaves from medium to large can be too acidic for raw consumption;\n\tIt is better to avoid yellow or obviously wilted leaves, and simply remove them from the beds;\n\tAfter collecting, sorrel quickly wither, but does not lose its taste.\n\n\nThis plant is quite fragile, and it should be stored in A refrigerator in a plastic bag no more than three days. The leaves of this plant are poorly dried, so this is not recommended. It can be frozen for subsequent use.|||Bloody Dock, Blood Doc, Red Breaking Dock buckwheat sorrel is found in Europe, North Africa, South-Western Asia, the type is decorative perennial, vegetable looks perfectly on the shore of a natural or artificial reservoir 40-50 juicy, fleshy, the base can have a red, burgundy tinted, overwhelmed bright or spaced bright or focused bright or spaced bright or spaced bright or sharp Dark green with contrasting red, medium -longer veins look very beautiful throughout the season and small 0.4 Star of early spring, in late April-early May, depending on the weather and climatic conditions, wet, drained, with a neutral and weak-resistant reaction, it is advisable to choose sunny places, but it can also grow in the partial shade, without losing its decorative and organic fertilizers with the division of the bush, the endless 5-8 years of June, the beginning of June, blooms in the second year in the second year. This kind of sorrel belongs to the buckwheat family. In nature, it is found in regions with moderate climate. You can see red sorrel on forest edges and on the banks of rivers. Most often it grows in sunny areas.\n\nThe plant has beautiful spear -shaped foliage with scarlet veins. The variety of red patterns stands out with a special coloring of leaf plates. However, the drawings on the foliage are especially clearly manifested if sorrel grows in the sun. In mid -summer, sorrel begins to bloom. Gardeners usually cut peduncles. If this is not done, the plants will multiply by self -sowing. Except Togo, in such conditions, the bushes will experience a lack of nutrients. Red -leaved sorrel can be grown in any area. It is best to plant it in the sun or in partial shade. The soil on the site should be loose. Good predecessors for this plant are nightshade and root crops.\n\nYou can sow soreel in March or April. The soil at this time is already well warmed up. Seeds are immersed in the soil by 1-2 centimeters. The distance between the rows should be within 30 centimeters. Decorative Spring is most often grown as a border plant. It looks great next to the fences or at the base of the alpine slides. Red -leaved sorrel goes well with dwarf cloves, angles, sage and lavender. In addition, it is often planted next to various herbs.|||RúMEX CRíSpus buckwheat sorrel sorrel-sorrel-sorrower is widespread in the northern hemisphere as a weed in the meadows and outskirts of the fields, along the banks of rivers, streams, ditches, near the roads, near the housing, a multi-year-old, vegetable, vegetable develops a rapidly tall 50-120 furrier, naked, reddish, red-colored erective. lanceolate, sharp, curly, 15-20 cm long, a thick panicle up to 60 cm, the root of the rod, long; Brown, fracture yellow three -sided nuts, Brown-shaped brown and small reddish or green red dilution of curly sorrel-non-prepared process, concluded between the overgrown shares of a perianth of 2-3 mm long, since the plant is a resilient and unhurried to care. For growing at home, it is necessary to plant it in a darkened place, in a well -moistened ground. The seeds of the plant are sown in the spring, immediately after the snow melts, into open ground. The weather for this should be dry, with plus indicators air temperatures. It should be planted in shallow pits up to 1.5 cm, leaving a distance of 20 cm between the seeds.\n\nFor stable growth, regular and abundant watering of perennials should be carried out. On non -fire days, there will be enough 15 liters per bush three times a week, and daily watering should be carried out on hot days. And also periodically do potassium and phosphorus top dressing. The plant -bearing shoots of the plant should be cut off immediately after the appearance, this will provide a density of greens and increase The number of useful elements.\n\nIn the event of winter, it is necessary to trim the aboveground part of the plant, leaving 1-2 cm from the ground, and cover with a dense layer of fallen leaves or peat to form humus and protection against strong subgalnum temperatures. It is impossible to grow curly sorrel on the site in the same place for more than 4-5 years. In June - July in August - September, sorrel Kurchavy - a type of grassy plant from the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae). The root is rod, long, brown. Stem It is erect, red, reaches 50-120 cm of height, has no notice. The leaves of lanceolate, oval shape, pointed, the edges are curly, up to 20 cm long. The flowers of the plant are small, light red shade or completely green, collected in a long - up to 60 cm - a thick, narrow shape of a complex inflorescence.\n\nThe formula of the sour flower is the following: *its3+3T6P (3). The fruits look like a small trihedral nut located between the perianths and the reddish tint placed on the leg appear in late August - early September. Both fruits and leaves have a sour taste, for which they are appreciated by cooks. For the first time, Kurchali's sorrel was discovered in Japan. The plant is found in many regions of Europe, Asia, America, Russia and the CIS countries. It grows on the territory of Siberia, on the coast of Kamchatka, in Primorye, in St. Petersburg and Arkhangelsk. It grows in the form of weeds next to rivers, ditches, roads, on the outskirts of meadows and fields.\n\nDue to the great love of moisture, this plant often lives in marshy areas. Skrevel Kurchavy loves wet medium -kept soils, as well as soils with a large predominance of clay and sand. The plant can withstand severe frosts, so it grows well even in the northern regions. Due to the strong root system, high viability and rapid vegetative propagation, a curly sorrel is attributed to rudral plants. It leads to a strong clogging of a personal plot, which prevents other plants and crops growing next to it.\n\nNegative The consequences for other crops are manifested in the following:\n\n\n\tThe soil next to Sorrel becomes colder by 1-4 degrees;\n\tThe effectiveness of fertilizer and irrigation of neighboring plants is reduced;\n\tThe risk of diseases is enhanced, since curly sorrel is susceptible to fungal infections that quickly spread throughout the site;\n\tThe weeding of the site is complicated due to the strong and deep roots of the plant."

Once - In autumn, only thick branches with cuttings from segments of the stem or leaves are toxic for cats and dogs unpretentious in leaving a biological point of view of the golden epiprem - this is one of the types of deciduous climbing plants. It is customary to attribute to the epipremum of the same name that is included in the aroid family. The botanists have not yet established whether this is a separate species, or nevertheless a subspecies of the periysty epipremnamum. But the region of origin was established for sure - this is French Polynesia. In the interior The plant is used around the world.\n\nOften it is cultivated not in simple land, but by the method of hydroponics. This additionally expands the use of an original suspension culture. In sources devoted to gardening, this species is also mentioned under a number of other names. It is called:\n\n\n\tPOSOS;\n\tgolden flower;\n\tScindapsus (including golden scindapsus - although from a botanical point of view this is obviously incorrect). The cultivation of golden epipremnum at home is directed mainly for decorative and decreased use. In nature, it blooms willingly, but in the room it will be extremely difficult to achieve this. A variegated plant will delight with a pleasant color with good light. Green -faced varieties develop in weak shading. But in any case, culture requires shading.\n\nGrowing an epiprem is possible in standard temperature mode, just in the room. However, drafts and piercing winds can destroy culture. Watering should go immediately after drying the upper layer of the soil mixture. At the same time, irrigation should be moderate. When using heating devices, including batteries, you will need to use a spraying spraying leaves. Liana of the epiprem is recommended to be propagated by cuttings. At least 2 leaves grow on a good cuttings. Planting material is placed in a substrate of peat and moss. It is necessary to keep such a culture at 20-22 degrees. Tanks are covered with glass or polyethylene.\n\nIn some cases, the cuttings are placed in water tank. When the roots are formed, the plant is transplanted into a flowerpot. The use of layering involves attaching an escape to the surface in a neighboring pot. After the formation of the roots, the layering is separated. Shields and thrips can affect the epipremnum golden. Pautetine ticks also pose a danger. These insects harm sheet plates. The affected leaves turn yellow and degrade. After removing harmful individuals from the plant with a soap solution with which the sponge is impregnated, The culture is treated with diluted insecticide.\n\nRowing of the roots is often provoked when waterlogging of soil substrates. This manifests itself with yellowing of leaves and the formation of rot. The lack of nutrient components leads to growth inhibitory. Excessively low temperature provokes darkening of the edge of the sheet. Spraying the infusion of orange peel helps to fight aphids.\n\nInsecticide drugs are ineffective against the shield. Spraying give the worst result than wetting The composition of a piece of fabric and tearing off the insect with your hands. Pautinic ticks are washed off with a warm shower. Only if this does not give a result, it is worth using branded insecticides."

2015\n                            Purpose: It is recommended to use in fresh and dried form as a taste supplement in home cooking and when canned\n                            View: Vegetable  As already mentioned, the basil of any variety can be grown on your own personal plot. For this, it is initially necessary to create the most comfortable growing conditions. The basil belongs to the category of heat -loving plants. For seed germination, it will be necessary to maintain air temperature at a level of +25 to +30 degrees Celsius. Also, in the process of growing, it is not recommended to allow lowering the temperature to +10 degrees. The temperature is below 0 degrees are completely destructive even for the stronger basil.\n\nThe basil is suitable for both open ground and for greenhouse conditions. It is better to equip a bed in a sunny site. In the shadow, the spice will also grow, but some changes will occur: the number of leaves will decrease, as well as the volume and qualitative indicators of essential oils will decrease. There are several ways to reproduce basil. A young bush can be grown directly from a cuttings taken from another plant. For this It is necessary to perform several simple steps.\n\n\n\tIf there is already at least one bush of basil, it can be propagated by cutting off several shoots or tops of the plant.\n\tThey must be put in a container with water for 1-2 weeks.\n\tIf in the process everything was done correctly, then after the indicated time the roots should appear on these cuttings.\n\tAs soon as the roots become large and strong, the basil can be transplanted into separate containers or directly into open ground.\n\tNext, you should wait from one up to a month and a half. If comfortable conditions were created for plantings, competent and timely care was provided, then after the specified time you can begin to collect the first crop.\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the basil, grown in this way, will bear fruit over the next 3-4 months. Growing a new plant from seeds is a longer and painstaking way, but such a bush will last you much longer than the one that has grown through cuttings. At Compliance with all the intricacies of agricultural technology Basilica is practically not terrible. In some cases, ailments such as fusariosis, black leg, gray rot can develop. All of them have a fungal nature of origin and occur, as a rule, due to improper watering or under the influence of cold air temperature. If in the process of growing it was possible to detect negative symptoms: the wilting of the spice, the appearance of the leaves and stems of non -characteristic spots of yellow, brown or black shades, it is necessary to immediately find out the nature of their origin. If it turns out that the presence of the disease is to blame for everything, the situation must be immediately corrected.\n\nSo, if fusariosis occurs, it is recommended to use either fungicidal preparations (“impact” or “Merpan”), or to use the folk method - processing basil with onion husk infusion. If a black leg occurs, it is recommended to immediately remove the affected shoots. The soil is treated with a solution of potassium permanganate, And the remaining basil for preventive purposes is sprayed with drugs such as “phytosporin” or “topaz”. It is recommended to use them in accordance with the instructions, and you need to comply with safety precautions."
